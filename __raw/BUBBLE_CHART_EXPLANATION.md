# Asset Efficiency Bubble Chart - Complete Explanation

## **What This Chart Shows:**

A visual comparison of how efficiently each airline uses its assets to generate profits, and whether they're expanding or contracting during the 2008 financial crisis.

---

## **The Three Visual Dimensions:**

### **1. Horizontal Position (X-Axis): Asset Growth %**

**What it measures:** Are airlines expanding or shrinking their asset base (planes, equipment, facilities)?

**Scale:** -16% (far left, shrinking fast) to +12% (far right, growing fast)

**Reading the position:**
- **Right side (positive):** Growing assets = Adding planes, expanding capacity, investing for future
- **Left side (negative):** Shrinking assets = Selling planes, cutting capacity, defensive mode
- **Center (near 0%):** Flat growth = Maintaining current size

**What each airline's position means:**

**Far Right (Growing):**
- **WestJet (+9.9%):** Adding planes and capacity aggressively
- **Continental (+4.8%):** Also growing, but into losses

**Center (Flat):**
- **Lufthansa (+0.4%):** Essentially frozen, not growing or shrinking

**Left Side (Shrinking):**
- **Air Canada (-4.0%):** Cutting capacity moderately
- **Singapore (-6.4%):** Cutting capacity significantly
- **Southwest (-14.7%):** Cutting capacity dramatically (fastest shrinkage)

**The Context:**
During the 2008 crisis, most airlines were cutting capacity (selling planes, reducing routes) to survive. Growing assets (+9.9%) when industry is contracting is extremely rare and signals confidence in business model.

---

### **2. Vertical Position (Y-Axis): Return on Assets (ROA) %**

**What it measures:** How much profit does each airline generate per dollar of assets?

**Formula:** Net Income ÷ Total Assets

**Scale:** -10% (bottom, massive losses) to +6% (top, high profitability)

**Reading the position:**
- **Top (positive):** Profitable = Earning money on assets
- **Bottom (negative):** Losses = Losing money on assets
- **Zero line:** Break-even point

**What each airline's position means:**

**High Profitability (Top):**
- **WestJet (5.4%):** Every $1 of assets generates $0.054 profit (best)
- **Singapore (4.6%):** $0.046 profit per $1 of assets (second best)
- **Lufthansa (2.7%):** $0.027 profit per $1 of assets (moderate)

**Low Profitability:**
- **Southwest (1.2%):** Barely profitable, only $0.012 per $1 of assets

**Losses (Bottom):**
- **Continental (-4.6%):** Losing $0.046 for every $1 of assets
- **Air Canada (-9.0%):** Losing $0.09 for every $1 of assets (worst)

**The Context:**
ROA above 5% is excellent for airlines (capital-intensive industry). WestJet's 5.4% is exceptional. Negative ROA means destroying shareholder value.

---

### **3. Bubble Size: Revenue Scale**

**What it measures:** How big is each airline by 2008 revenue?

**Data:** Revenue normalized to USD billions for comparison

**Reading the size:**
- **Larger bubble:** Bigger airline, more revenue
- **Smaller bubble:** Smaller airline, less revenue

**Relative sizes:**

| Airline | Revenue (USD B) | Bubble Size | Relative to WestJet |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Lufthansa** | $34.87B | **Largest** | 17x bigger |
| **Continental** | $15.24B | Large | 7x bigger |
| **Southwest** | $11.02B | Large | 5x bigger |
| **Singapore** | $10.53B | Large | 5x bigger |
| **Air Canada** | $8.35B | Medium | 4x bigger |
| **WestJet** | $2.08B | **Smallest** | Baseline |

**The Context:**
WestJet is 4-17x smaller than competitors by revenue. The visual shows tiny WestJet bubble beating massive competitor bubbles. This is the "David vs Goliath" story.

## **The Four Quadrants Explained:**

The chart is divided into four strategic zones by the zero lines:

### **Top-Right: "IDEAL POSITION" (Growth + Profitability)**

**Characteristics:**
- Growing assets (expanding)
- High ROA (profitable)
- Best strategic position

**Airlines Here:**
- ✓ **WestJet ONLY**

**What This Means:**
WestJet is the ONLY airline achieving both growth AND profitability during the crisis. This is the rarest and most valuable position. Shows sustainable competitive advantage.

**Implications:**
- Growing market share
- Profitable growth (not desperate)
- Positioned for post-crisis dominance
- Sustainable business model

---

### **Top-Left: "DEFENSIVE POSITION" (Shrinking + Profitability)**

**Characteristics:**
- Shrinking assets (contracting)
- High ROA (profitable)
- Defensive but stable

**Airlines Here:**
- Singapore Airlines
- (Lufthansa is near center, borderline)

**What This Means:**
These airlines are profitable but cutting capacity. Defensive posture during crisis - preserving cash, waiting for recovery. Sacrificing growth for survival.

**Implications:**
- Conservative management
- Protecting margins over market share
- Will need to re-grow post-crisis
- Missing opportunity to gain share

---

### **Bottom-Right: "DANGER ZONE" (Growth + Losses)**

**Characteristics:**
- Growing assets (expanding)
- Negative ROA (losses)
- Most dangerous position

**Airlines Here:**
- Continental Airlines

**What This Means:**
Growing into losses. Adding capacity that isn't profitable. Either desperate attempt to maintain market position or failed growth strategy. Burning cash while expanding.

**Implications:**
- Unsustainable trajectory
- Likely headed for bankruptcy
- Growing makes losses worse
- Need immediate turnaround

**Historical Note:**
Continental later merged with United (2010) after near-bankruptcy. This chart predicted the outcome.

---

### **Bottom-Left: "DISTRESSED" (Shrinking + Losses)**

**Characteristics:**
- Shrinking assets (contracting)
- Negative ROA (losses)
- Worst strategic position

**Airlines Here:**
- Air Canada (worst position)
- Southwest (better than Air Canada but still distressed)

**What This Means:**
Shrinking AND losing money. Death spiral territory. Cutting capacity to stop losses, but losses continue. Limited options remaining.

**Implications:**
- Bankruptcy risk high
- Emergency measures needed
- Losing market share
- May not survive

**Historical Note:**
Air Canada nearly filed for bankruptcy again in 2009 (had just emerged from bankruptcy in 2004). Southwest survived but took years to recover profitability.

---

## **Reading Individual Airline Stories:**

### **1. WestJet (Small Blue Bubble, Top-Right)**

**Position:**
- X: +9.9% (far right, growing fast)
- Y: +5.4% (top, most profitable)
- Size: $2.08B (smallest)

**The Story:**
WestJet is the smallest airline but occupies the best strategic position. Growing capacity (+9.9%) while maintaining highest profitability (5.4% ROA). Only airline achieving both growth AND profitability.

**Why This Matters:**
In a crisis, most companies choose survival (cut capacity, preserve cash) or growth (expand but burn cash). WestJet did both - grew AND stayed profitable. This is extremely rare and indicates structural competitive advantage.

**Investment Implication:**
Small size is not weakness. WestJet's nimble, low-cost model allowed it to grow profitably when giants couldn't. The smallest bubble in the best position is the most compelling investment story.

---

### **2. Lufthansa (Largest Blue Bubble, Center)**

**Position:**
- X: +0.4% (center, essentially flat)
- Y: +2.7% (middle, moderately profitable)
- Size: $34.87B (largest)

**The Story:**
Lufthansa is the largest airline by revenue but stuck in the middle strategically. Not growing (+0.4% essentially flat), moderate profitability (2.7% ROA). Treading water.

**Why This Matters:**
Size doesn't guarantee success. Despite being 17x larger than WestJet, Lufthansa has lower profitability and no growth. The massive bubble stuck in the center shows scale without momentum.

**The Paradox:**
Lufthansa's operating income showed +2753% growth (outlier from near-zero 2007 base), but ROA is only 2.7%. This shows recovery from losses, not sustainable high performance.

---

### **3. Singapore Airlines (Large Purple Bubble, Top-Left)**

**Position:**
- X: -6.4% (left, shrinking)
- Y: +4.6% (high, second-best profitability)
- Size: $10.53B (large)

**The Story:**
Singapore is profitable (4.6% ROA, second only to WestJet) but shrinking capacity (-6.4%). Defensive strategy - cut capacity to preserve margins. Conservative crisis management.

**Why This Matters:**
Premium airline model (Singapore is luxury carrier) is profitable but not growing. High capital intensity (new planes, premium service) makes growth expensive. Chose profitability over market share.

**Comparison to WestJet:**
Similar profit margins (Singapore 7.2% net margin, WestJet 7.0% net margin) but WestJet achieves it with lower capital requirements. Singapore's 4.6% ROA vs WestJet's 5.4% ROA shows capital efficiency difference.

---

### **4. Southwest (Large Light Blue Bubble, Left Side)**

**Position:**
- X: -14.7% (far left, shrinking fastest)
- Y: +1.2% (barely profitable)
- Size: $11.02B (large)

**The Story:**
Southwest is shrinking capacity dramatically (-14.7%, fastest shrinkage) and barely profitable (1.2% ROA). This is WestJet's closest competitor (both low-cost carriers) but performing much worse.

**Why This Matters:**
Southwest invented the low-cost carrier model that WestJet copied. But in 2008 crisis, the student (WestJet) vastly outperformed the teacher (Southwest). Southwest's -14.7% capacity cut vs WestJet's +9.9% growth is a 24.6 percentage point difference.

**The Question:**
If Southwest and WestJet have similar business models, why such different results? Answer: WestJet's newer fleet, non-union workforce, and Canadian market positioning provided more flexibility.

---

### **5. Continental (Large Pink Bubble, Bottom-Right)**

**Position:**
- X: +4.8% (right, growing)
- Y: -4.6% (bottom, losing money)
- Size: $15.24B (large)

**The Story:**
Continental is growing capacity (+4.8%) while losing money on every dollar of assets (-4.6% ROA). Classic "growing into losses" pattern. Adding capacity that destroys value.

**Why This Matters:**
This is the most dangerous quadrant. Growing makes losses accelerate. Continental added planes/routes but couldn't fill them profitably. Legacy carrier cost structure (unions, pensions, hub complexity) prevents profitability even with growth.

**The Warning:**
Only WestJet and Continental are growing (right side of chart), but with opposite results. WestJet +9.9% growth with +5.4% ROA vs Continental +4.8% growth with -4.6% ROA. Growth quality matters more than growth quantity.

**Historical Outcome:**
Continental merged with United in 2010 after near-bankruptcy. The bubble chart predicted this outcome.

---

### **6. Air Canada (Medium Red Bubble, Bottom-Left)**

**Position:**
- X: -4.0% (left, shrinking)
- Y: -9.0% (bottom, worst losses)
- Size: $8.35B (medium)

**The Story:**
Air Canada is in the worst position. Shrinking capacity (-4.0%) yet still posting massive losses (-9.0% ROA, worst in group). Death spiral - cutting capacity doesn't stop hemorrhaging.

**Why This Matters:**
This is WestJet's direct competitor in Canadian market. WestJet (growing +9.9%, profitable +5.4%) vs Air Canada (shrinking -4.0%, losing -9.0%) is a 13.9 percentage point gap in assets and 14.4 percentage point gap in ROA. WestJet is taking market share from failing Air Canada.

**The Competitive Dynamic:**
As Air Canada cuts routes and capacity, WestJet fills the void. This is visible in the chart - WestJet growing as Air Canada shrinks. Classic market share transfer from weak incumbent to strong challenger.

**Historical Context:**
Air Canada emerged from bankruptcy in 2004, then went back near bankruptcy in 2009. This chart captures the airline at its lowest point.

## **Key Patterns and Insights:**

### **Pattern 1: Size vs Performance (Inverse Relationship)**

**Observation:**
The smallest airline (WestJet) has the best strategic position. The largest airline (Lufthansa) is stuck in the middle. No correlation between size and success.

**Chart Evidence:**
- WestJet: Smallest bubble, best position (top-right)
- Lufthansa: Largest bubble, mediocre position (center)
- Air Canada: Medium bubble, worst position (bottom-left)

**Insight:**
In crisis, size is liability not advantage. Large airlines have:
- Complex hub-and-spoke networks (inflexible)
- Legacy costs (unions, pensions)
- Older fleets (less fuel efficient)
- Bureaucratic decision-making (slow to adapt)

Small airlines have:
- Simple point-to-point routes (flexible)
- Lower cost structure (non-union)
- Newer fleets (efficient)
- Fast decision-making (nimble)

**Investment Implication:**
Don't assume large = safe. In disruption, small + agile > large + slow.

---

### **Pattern 2: Business Model Matters**

**Low-Cost Carriers (LCC):**
- WestJet: Growing +9.9%, profitable +5.4% (winning)
- Southwest: Shrinking -14.7%, barely profitable +1.2% (struggling)

**Legacy Carriers:**
- Continental: Growing +4.8%, losses -4.6% (failing)
- Air Canada: Shrinking -4.0%, massive losses -9.0% (disaster)

**Premium Carriers:**
- Singapore: Shrinking -6.4%, profitable +4.6% (defensive)
- Lufthansa: Flat +0.4%, profitable +2.7% (stagnant)

**Insight:**
Low-cost model has advantage in crisis (WestJet winning), but execution matters (Southwest struggling despite same model). Legacy carriers uniformly struggling regardless of growth strategy. Premium carriers profitable but defensive.

---

### **Pattern 3: The Growth-Profit Trade-Off**

**Traditional Wisdom:**
Can't achieve both growth and profitability simultaneously. Must choose.

**Chart Evidence:**
Only one airline (WestJet) achieved both. All others made trade-offs:
- Singapore: Chose profit over growth (cut capacity to preserve margins)
- Continental: Chose growth over profit (grew into losses)
- Southwest: Achieved neither (cut capacity, barely profitable)
- Air Canada: Achieved neither (cut capacity, massive losses)

**WestJet's Advantage:**
Structural cost advantage allowed profitable growth. This is competitive moat evidence.

---

### **Pattern 4: Shrinking is Not Solution**

**Intuition:**
If losing money, cut capacity to reduce losses.

**Chart Evidence:**
Doesn't work:
- Southwest: Cut capacity -14.7%, still only 1.2% ROA (barely profitable)
- Air Canada: Cut capacity -4.0%, still -9.0% ROA (massive losses)
- Singapore: Cut capacity -6.4%, maintained 4.6% ROA (this worked)

**Insight:**
Shrinking works if you're efficient (Singapore maintained profitability). Shrinking fails if you have structural cost problems (Southwest, Air Canada). You can't cut your way to prosperity unless underlying economics are sound.

---

### **Pattern 5: The "Stuck in the Middle" Problem**

**Observation:**
Airlines near the center (Lufthansa) have no clear strategy. Not growing or shrinking. Not highly profitable or distressed. Just existing.

**Chart Evidence:**
Lufthansa (+0.4% growth, 2.7% ROA) is largest but least interesting strategically. No momentum in either direction.

**Insight:**
In crisis, need decisive strategy. Either grow (WestJet), defend profitably (Singapore), or restructure (Continental/Air Canada need to but aren't). Treading water doesn't work long-term.

---

## **The Investment Decision Framework:**

### **What This Chart Tells Investors:**

**Fundamental Analysis:**
WestJet has best strategic position among all airlines. Only one achieving growth + profitability.

**Relative Valuation:**
If you believe position in this chart predicts future success, WestJet should have premium valuation. But case shows WestJet stock down 50% (similar to peers).

**The Disconnect:**
Best fundamentals (top-right position) but mediocre stock performance. Why?

---

### **Three Investment Theses:**

**Thesis 1: Market Inefficiency (Buy)**

**Argument:**
- Chart shows WestJet in best position
- Stock price doesn't reflect this (down 50%)
- Market lumping all airlines together
- Opportunity to buy quality at distressed price

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Best ROA (5.4%)
- Only airline growing profitably
- Taking market share from Air Canada
- Structural cost advantage

**Risk:**
Market may stay irrational longer than you stay solvent

---

**Thesis 2: Unsustainable Growth (Sell)**

**Argument:**
- 9.9% asset growth in crisis is reckless
- WestJet adding capacity that won't fill profitably post-crisis
- Following Continental's path (growth into losses)
- Stock price correctly anticipating future deterioration

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Operating income already down -2.3%
- CASM (costs) rising faster than RASM (revenue)
- Margin compression starting
- Fuel volatility risk

**Counter:**
WestJet's RASM-CASM spread (1.7¢) still positive. Not growing into losses like Continental (-1.0¢ spread).

---

**Thesis 3: Peak Earnings (Hold)**

**Argument:**
- 2008 represents peak performance
- ROA will normalize lower as growth slows
- Stock price correctly reflecting forward, not backward performance
- Fair value, neither buy nor sell

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Net income growth -7.8% (already declining)
- Industry headwinds intensifying (2009 forecast: -$9B industry loss)
- Limited upside from current position

**Counter:**
If 5.4% ROA is "peak," what's normal? Even 3-4% ROA would be excellent for airlines.

---

## **Common Questions & Answers:**

### **Q1: Why is bubble size important?**

**A:** Shows WestJet achieved best results despite being smallest. If WestJet were largest, success might be attributed to scale. Being smallest makes achievement more impressive - proves business model advantage, not size advantage.

---

### **Q2: Why use ROA instead of ROE?**

**A:** ROA measures asset efficiency regardless of capital structure (debt vs equity). ROE can be manipulated with leverage. In crisis, asset efficiency more important than leverage games.

---

### **Q3: Is 9.9% asset growth too aggressive?**

**A:** Context matters. If ROA remained 5.4% while growing 9.9%, growth is quality growth. If ROA was declining (like Continental), growth would be concerning. WestJet's ROA actually highest despite growth, proving growth is profitable.

---

### **Q4: Why is Southwest shrinking so fast (-14.7%)?**

**A:** Southwest's hedging strategy failed. They locked in high fuel prices before crash. Also aging fleet and unionized workforce reduced flexibility. Forced to cut capacity to reduce losses.

---

### **Q5: How long can WestJet maintain this position?**

**A:** The key question. Top-right position is rare and attracts competition. Either:
- Sustainable (structural advantage) = Buy
- Temporary (cyclical) = Sell
- Chart doesn't answer this. Need to assess business model durability.

---

### **Q6: What would make WestJet move quadrants?**

**Move to Top-Left (Defensive):**
- If WestJet stopped growing (asset growth → 0%)
- Would indicate management pivoting to preservation

**Move to Bottom-Right (Danger):**
- If profitability deteriorated (ROA → negative)
- Would indicate growth unsustainable
- Warning signal

**Stay Top-Right:**
- Requires maintaining both growth + profitability
- Hardest to sustain but most valuable

---

## **Technical Notes:**

### **Data Normalization:**

**Revenue Conversion to USD:**
- Southwest: $11.02B (already USD)
- Continental: $15.24B (already USD)
- Lufthansa: €25.05B ÷ 0.718 = $34.87B USD
- Singapore: SGD$16.00B ÷ 1.52 = $10.53B USD
- Air Canada: C$10.23B ÷ 1.224 = $8.35B USD
- WestJet: C$2.55B ÷ 1.224 = $2.08B USD

**Why Normalize:**
Makes bubble sizes comparable. Otherwise can't tell if Lufthansa is "bigger" than Singapore (different currencies).

---

### **Bubble Size Scaling:**

Chart uses revenue because:
- Universally understood (bigger revenue = bigger airline)
- Correlates with asset base
- Easy to visualize

Could alternatively use:
- Total assets (more directly related to X-axis)
- Market capitalization (investor perspective)
- Number of planes (operational view)

Revenue chosen for simplicity and comparability.

---

### **Why Scatter Chart, Not True Bubble Chart:**

Technical limitation: True bubble charts in Excel require three dimensions but are harder to format. Scatter chart with sized markers achieves same visual effect with better control over appearance.

---

## **The Bottom Line:**

**What This Chart Proves:**
WestJet occupied the best strategic position among all airlines in 2008 - the only airline achieving profitable growth during worst industry crisis in history.

**What This Chart Suggests:**
Small, nimble, low-cost business model outperformed large, complex, legacy models during disruption.

**What This Chart Doesn't Answer:**
Is this position sustainable, or was 2008 WestJet's peak? Stock price suggests market is skeptical. Fundamental analysis suggests skepticism is unwarranted.

**The Investment Decision:**
Depends on your view of sustainability. If WestJet's competitive advantages are structural, the top-right position will persist and stock is undervalued. If advantages are temporary, position will deteriorate and stock is fairly valued.

**This chart is the starting point for that debate, not the conclusion.**
