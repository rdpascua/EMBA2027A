# Growth Performance: Large vs Small Players - Chart Guide

## **The Story You're Telling:**

"WestJet, the smallest player, outperformed all the industry giants during the 2008 crisis"

---

## **Recommended Chart: Grouped by Size with Bubble Overlay**

### **Chart Type: Clustered Column with Size Indicator**

**Visual Concept:**
- Group airlines by size category (Large vs Small)
- Show growth metrics as bars
- Use visual separation to emphasize David vs Goliath story

---

## **Option 1: Side-by-Side Comparison (Best for Your Story)**

### **Chart Setup:**

**Layout:**
Two distinct sections separated by space or vertical line:

**LEFT SIDE: "Large Players (>$10B Revenue)"**
- Lufthansa (€25.05B)
- Singapore (SGD$16.00B)
- Continental ($15.24B)
- Southwest ($11.02B)
- Air Canada (C$10.23B)

**RIGHT SIDE: "Small Player (<$5B Revenue)"**
- WestJet (C$2.55B)

**Metrics Shown:**
- Blue bars: Sales Growth %
- Orange bars: Operating Income Growth %
- Green bars: Net Income Growth %

---

### **Excel Steps:**

1. **Create Two Separate Charts Side-by-Side**

**Chart 1 (Large Players):**
- Title: "Large Players (>$10B Revenue) - 2008 Growth Performance"
- X-axis: 5 large airlines
- Y-axis: Growth % (-400% to +30%)
- 3 bars per airline

**Chart 2 (Small Player):**
- Title: "Small Player (<$5B Revenue) - 2008 Growth Performance"
- Same Y-axis scale (-400% to +30%) for comparison
- Single airline (WestJet) with 3 bars
- **Make WestJet bars visually distinct** (brighter colors, bold)

2. **Position charts side-by-side** on same sheet with visual separation

---

## **Option 2: Single Chart with Size Annotation**

### **Chart Setup:**

**Order airlines by revenue size (largest to smallest):**

1. Lufthansa (€25B) - Label: "LARGE"
2. Singapore (SGD$16B) - Label: "LARGE"
3. Continental ($15B) - Label: "LARGE"
4. Southwest ($11B) - Label: "LARGE"
5. Air Canada (C$10B) - Label: "LARGE"
6. **[Visual Break/Space]**
7. **WestJet (C$2.6B)** - Label: "**SMALL**" in bold/different color

**Add Elements:**
- Horizontal separator line between Air Canada and WestJet
- Text box: "10x size difference" with arrow
- WestJet section highlighted with subtle background color

---

## **Option 3: Bubble Chart (Most Sophisticated)**

### **Chart Type:** Scatter with Bubble Sizing

**Axes:**
- X-axis: Sales Growth %
- Y-axis: Operating Income Growth % (or Net Income Growth %)
- Bubble size: 2008 Revenue (larger bubble = larger airline)

**What This Shows:**
- Position = Growth performance
- Size = Company scale
- **Visual punchline:** Tiny WestJet bubble in top-right (best growth), huge Continental/Air Canada bubbles in bottom-left (worst performance)

**Quadrants:**
- Top-Right: High sales growth, high profit growth (ideal) - **WestJet here**
- Top-Left: Low sales growth, high profit growth
- Bottom-Right: High sales growth, low/negative profit growth
- Bottom-Left: Low sales growth, negative profit growth - **Large players here**

---

## **The Narrative Structure:**

### **Title Recommendations:**

**Option A (Neutral):**
"2008 Airline Growth Performance: Large vs Small Players"

**Option B (Provocative):**
"David vs Goliath: How the Smallest Airline Outgrew the Giants"

**Option C (Data-Driven):**
"WestJet (C$2.6B) Outperforms Airlines 4-10x Its Size"

by revenue, yet achieved best growth"
```

### **2. Performance Callout:**

**Large Players (Struggling):**
- Muted colors: Gray, light blue, pale orange
- Signals: Distress, struggling, background

**WestJet (Winner):**
- Bold colors: Dark blue, bright green, gold
- Signals: Strong, successful, spotlight

### **Layout Emphasis:**

**De-emphasize large players:**
- Smaller bars/bubbles
- Muted colors
- Less detail

## **Alternative: Waterfall Chart Showing Relative Performance**

### **Concept:**
Show how each airline performed relative to industry average

**Starting point:** Industry average growth
**Steps:**
- Each airline adds/subtracts from average
- WestJet's bar shoots up (positive contribution)
- Large players' bars drop down (negative contribution)

**Ending point:** Weighted average with WestJet vs without

## **Key Insight Box to Add:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
KEY FINDING:

WestJet (C$2.6B revenue) outperformed
airlines 4-10x its size:

• Highest sales growth: 18.5%
  (vs 6.7% average for large players)

• Best profit protection: -2.3%
  (vs -85% average for large players)

• Only airline growing AND profitable
  during worst airline crisis in history

IMPLICATION:
Size is not advantage in crisis.
Efficiency and flexibility win.
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

## **Why This Framing Works:**

1. **Sets Expectations:** Large = should be stable, resilient
2. **Subverts Expectations:** Large = failed, small = succeeded
3. **Creates Contrast:** Makes WestJet's achievement more impressive
4. **Answers "So What?":** Small, nimble business model beats large, inflexible model in crisis

---

## **Your Chart Fix:**

**Current Problem:** Missing the size context entirely

**Solution:** Add size indicators to your chart:

1. **Above each airline name, add revenue in parentheses:**
   - Southwest (US$11.0B)
   - Lufthansa (€25.0B)
   - Singapore (SGD$16.0B)
   - WestJet (C$2.6B)

2. **Add subtitle:** "Performance by Company Size - 2008"

3. **Add annotation:** "WestJet: Smallest by revenue (C$2.6B), Largest by growth (18.5%)"

4. **Include Continental & Air Canada** to show full picture of large player struggles

---

**This reframes the entire story: "Small beat big" is much more compelling than "WestJet did well"**
