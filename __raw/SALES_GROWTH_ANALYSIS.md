- Fuel hedging strategy paid off in volatile market

### **💪 MAINTAINED LEADERSHIP (Crisis Resilient):**

**WestJet Airlines:**
- 2007: 21.3% → 2008: 18.5% (-2.8pts)
- **#1 in BOTH years despite crisis**

- Low-cost + domestic focus = crisis protection

**Lufthansa:**
- 2007: 12.7% → 2008: 11.1% (-1.6pts)
- Strong both years, minimal crisis impact
- Diversified revenue (cargo, catering, MRO) cushioned blow
- European market resilience

### **⚠️ DECELERATED (Crisis Vulnerable):**

**Continental Airlines:**
- 2007: 8.4% → 2008: 7.1% (-1.3pts)
- Moderate deceleration
- High leverage amplified crisis impact
- Lost equity base (-93.2%) despite maintaining revenue growth

- **Worst deceleration by far**
- Premium long-haul international routes devastated

---

## **Key Insights:**

### **1. Low-Cost Carriers Thrived in Crisis**

**WestJet and Southwest** (both LCCs) were the only airlines to maintain strong performance:
- **WestJet:** 21.3% → 18.5% (still #1)
- **Southwest:** 8.5% → 11.8% (accelerated)

**Why?**
- Price-sensitive demand shifted to budget airlines
- Domestic focus avoided international travel collapse
- Flexible cost structures adapted faster
- No business class = no premium revenue cliff

**Legacy carriers struggled:**
- Continental, Air Canada: Decelerated
- Singapore: Collapsed from premium route exposure

### **2. Singapore's Collapse Reveals Crisis Severity**

**10.2% → 0.1%** = Lost 10.1 percentage points

This wasn't just deceleration—it was **revenue growth evaporation**:
- Long-haul international travel collapsed
- Premium cabin demand disappeared
- Asian markets hit first (Lehman Brothers Sept 2008)
- Singapore's strength (premium service) became weakness

**Context:**
- Singapore had been growing 10.2% pre-crisis
- Crisis wiped out ALL growth momentum
- Revenue essentially flatlined ($15.97B → $16.00B)

### **3. WestJet's Resilience Pattern**

**Why WestJet maintained #1 despite crisis:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Starting Position** | Highest growth base (21.3% in 2007) |
| **Crisis Decline** | Small drop (-2.8pts) shows stability |
| **2008 Leadership** | Still 6.7pts ahead of #2 (Southwest 11.8%) |
| **Business Model** | Low-cost + domestic = crisis protection |
| **Market Share** | Gained share as passengers traded down |

**The Math:**
- WestJet 2008: 18.5% growth
- Industry average 2008: 6.9% growth
- **WestJet advantage: +11.6pts above average**

### **4. Business Model > Size in Crisis**

**Top Performers:**
- WestJet (smallest): 18.5% growth
- Southwest (mid-size): 11.8% growth

**Bottom Performers:**
- Singapore (large): 0.1% growth
- Continental (large): 7.1% growth

**No correlation between size and growth resilience.**

What mattered:
- ✅ Cost structure (low-cost beat legacy)
- ✅ Route network (domestic beat international)
- ✅ Business model flexibility (LCC beat full-service)
- ❌ Size (no advantage)

## **Famous Quote for Context:**

### **Warren Buffett:**
> **"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."**

**Application:**
- 2007: Everyone growing, tide coming in
- 2008: Tide went out, exposed weak models
- Singapore: Swimming naked (premium long-haul vulnerable)
- WestJet: Wearing a swimsuit (low-cost domestic resilient)

### **Mark Twain:**
> **"It ain't the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog."**

**Application:**
- WestJet (smallest airline) had most "fight"
- Maintained #1 growth despite being 4-10x smaller
- Size didn't protect Singapore, Continental, Air Canada

## **Q&A:**

### **Q: Why did Southwest accelerate while others decelerated?**

**A:** Southwest's unique position:
1. **Fuel hedging:** Locked in lower fuel prices pre-crisis
2. **Domestic focus:** Avoided international travel collapse
3. **No legacy costs:** No pension obligations weighing down competitors
4. **Market share gains:** Passengers traded down from legacy carriers
5. **Strong balance sheet:** Could invest while others cut back

Result: Crisis became opportunity (+3.3pts acceleration)

### **Q: Why did Singapore collapse so badly?**

**A:** Perfect storm of vulnerabilities:
1. **Premium positioning:** Business/first class demand evaporated
2. **Long-haul international:** Routes hit hardest by crisis
3. **Asian exposure:** Asian markets crashed first (Sept 2008)
4. **High cost structure:** Couldn't compete on price when demand shifted
5. **Limited domestic market:** Singapore too small for domestic buffer

Result: 10.2% growth → 0.1% (worst crisis impact)

### **Q: What's more impressive—WestJet's 21.3% in 2007 or 18.5% in 2008?**

**A:** **18.5% in 2008 is more impressive:**

**2007 (21.3%):**
- Industry tailwind (all airlines growing)
- No major headwinds
- Natural market expansion

**2008 (18.5%):**
- Industry headwind (crisis hitting all airlines)
- Competitors collapsing around them
- Maintained growth while others went to near-zero
- Showed business model resilience under stress

**Context:**
- 2008 average growth: 6.9%
- WestJet's 18.5% in crisis = 2.7x average
- Singapore's collapse (10.2% → 0.1%) shows how hard 2008 was

### **Q: Is 18.5% growth sustainable?**

**A:** Chart shows **deceleration trend** (-2.8pts):
- 2007: 21.3%
- 2008: 18.5%
- Trend: Slowing

**Sustainability concerns:**
1. Cannot grow 18%+ forever (math impossible)
2. Market share gains have limits
3. Expansion constrained by aircraft/pilots/airports
4. Competition will respond

**However:**
- Still 2.7x industry average (significant margin)
- Low-cost model supports above-market growth
- Canadian market less saturated than US
- Crisis may have accelerated multi-year trend

**Investment question:** Is this peak growth (Sell) or new normal (Buy)?

### **Q: How do you explain WestJet's stock drop despite best sales growth?**

**A:** Market pricing in concerns beyond top-line:

**What chart shows (Positive):**
- Best sales growth (18.5%)
- Maintained leadership
- Crisis resilient

**What market worries about (Negative):**
- Profitability declining (-7.8% net income growth)
- Peak growth concerns (21.3% → 18.5% deceleration)
- Small size = limited institutional investor interest
- Canadian market saturation risks
- Fuel price volatility exposure

**Stock price disconnect:**
- Fundamentals say: Best performer
- Market says: Unsustainable, priced to perfection
- **Your job:** Determine who's right

## **Technical Notes:**

### **Why separate 2007 and 2008 charts?**

**CFA's concern:** Combined charts don't clearly show which year

**Solution:**
- Two separate bar charts (2007, 2008)
- Same Y-axis scale (0-25%) for visual comparison
- Different colors (Blue = pre-crisis, Orange = crisis)
- Each clearly labeled with year in title

**Benefit:**
- Immediate visual comparison side-by-side
- Shows trend (who accelerated vs decelerated)
- Avoids confusion about which data is which year

### **Alternative: Side-by-side clustered column?**

**Pros:**
- Shows both years in one chart
- Direct comparison

**Cons:**
- Cluttered (12 bars total)
- Hard to read exact values
- Loses individual year focus

**Recommendation:** Use separate charts for clarity, add third "change" chart for trend analysis.
