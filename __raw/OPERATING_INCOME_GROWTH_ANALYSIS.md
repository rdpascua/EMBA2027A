# Operating Income Growth Analysis: 2007 vs 2008

## **The Story:**

"Sales growth tells you if you're winning customers. Operating income growth tells you if you're making money. In 2008, WestJet was the ONLY airline that protected profits."

## **🚨 CRITICAL FINDING:**

### **WestJet Had BEST Profit Protection in Crisis**

**2008 Operating Income Growth:**
- **WestJet: -2.3%** (barely declined)
- Southwest: -43.2% (next best, but 18x worse)
- Singapore: -57.5%
- Air Canada: -133.1%
- Continental: -145.7%

**What this means:**
- WestJet's operating income dropped only 2.3%
- Competitors' operating income collapsed 43% to 145%
- **WestJet was 41 percentage points better than #2**

---

## **Key Points:**

### **1. ALL Airlines (Except Lufthansa) Had Negative Operating Income Growth**

**The universal pattern:**
- Every airline saw operating income decline in 2008
- No one escaped the crisis
- Range: -2.3% (WestJet) to -145.7% (Continental)

**Why it matters:**
- Revenue could stay stable (Continental 7.1% growth)
- But profits collapsed universally
- **Operating leverage worked in reverse**

---

### **2. WestJet's -2.3% Is Exceptional Performance**

**Context:**
- WestJet operating income: C$300M → C$293M (-2.3%)
- Lost only C$7M in operating profit

**Compare to:**
- Continental: $687M → -$314M (-145.7%)
- Lost $1.0B in operating profit
- Air Canada: C$495M → -C$164M (-133.1%)
- Lost C$659M in operating profit

**The difference:**
- WestJet: Lost $7M (manageable)
- Continental: Lost $1,000M (catastrophic)
- **143x difference in magnitude**

---

### **3. Operating Income More Sensitive Than Revenue**

**WestJet:**
- Revenue growth: +18.5%
- Operating income growth: -2.3%
- **21.8 percentage point spread**

**Continental:**
- Revenue growth: +7.1%
- Operating income growth: -145.7%
- **152.8 percentage point spread**

**What this reveals:**
- Costs rose faster than revenue for everyone
- WestJet's cost control kept spread minimal (21.8pts)
- Continental's costs exploded (152.8pts spread)
- **Operating leverage amplifies crisis impact**

---

### **4. The Lufthansa Outlier: 2753.3% Growth**

**What happened:**
- 2007: €15M operating income (near-zero)
- 2008: €428M operating income
- Growth: 2753.3% (meaningless statistic)

**Why it's an outlier:**
- NOT operational excellence
- Recovery from artificially low 2007 base
- Near-zero denominator creates huge percentage
- **Ignore for competitive analysis**

**Chart impact:**
- Breaks the scale (2753% vs -145% range)
- Makes other airlines unreadable
- **Exclude Lufthansa for clean view**

---

### **5. Continental and Air Canada: Profit Collapse Despite Revenue Growth**

**Continental:**
- Revenue: +7.1% growth
- Operating income: -145.7% decline
- **From $687M profit to $314M loss**

**How is this possible?**
- Revenue up $1.0B
- Costs up $2.0B
- **Growing revenue while losing money faster**

**Air Canada:**
- Revenue: +3.5% growth
- Operating income: -133.1% decline
- **From C$495M profit to C$164M loss**

**The trap:**
- High fixed costs (pensions, hubs, unions)
- Can't cut costs as fast as revenue
- Operating leverage crushes profitability
- **Death spiral: more revenue = more losses**

---

### **6. Singapore: From Best to Worst**

**2007:**
- Operating income growth: 61.7% (best)
- Strong premium demand, Asian expansion

**2008:**
- Operating income growth: -57.5%
- Premium demand evaporated

**What changed:**
- Business class revenue collapsed
- Long-haul routes unprofitable
- Premium positioning = vulnerability
- **From winner to loser in one year**

---

## **Detailed Analysis:**

### **Why WestJet's -2.3% Is the Best Performance:**

**1. Started Strong (2007: 50.8%)**
- Third-best operating income growth in 2007
- Solid baseline performance
- Not a one-year wonder

**2. Minimal Crisis Impact (2008: -2.3%)**
- Operating income: C$300M → C$293M
- Maintained profitability
- Costs controlled despite crisis

**3. Margin Resilience**
- 2007: 13.9% operating margin
- 2008: 11.5% operating margin
- **Only 2.4pt compression** (best in industry)

**4. Cost Discipline**
- Operating expenses: 80.1% → 83.2% of revenue
- Only 3.1pt increase (others had 5-10pt increases)
- **Low-cost model protected margins**

---

### **Why Continental/Air Canada Collapsed:**

**Continental: 46.8% → -145.7% (-192.5pt swing)**

**The breakdown:**
- 2007: $14.2B revenue, $687M operating income (4.8% margin)
- 2008: $15.2B revenue, -$314M operating loss (-2.1% margin)

**What went wrong:**
1. **Fixed cost base too high**
   - Hub infrastructure costs
   - Union contracts
   - Legacy IT systems
   - Can't cut fast enough

2. **Operating leverage in reverse**
   - Revenue +7.1%, Costs +15.7%
   - Every new revenue dollar cost $2+ to generate
   - **Negative unit economics**

3. **Fuel spike hit hardest**
   - No fuel hedging (unlike Southwest)
   - High fuel burn (old fleet)
   - Costs exploded mid-2008

4. **Pricing pressure**
   - Had to match LCC prices to fill planes
   - Revenue per seat fell
   - **Race to the bottom on fares**

**Air Canada: 91.1% → -133.1% (-224.2pt swing)**

**Even worse than Continental:**
- Went from 91% growth to -133% decline
- Total 224 percentage point swing
- Canadian market smaller = less pricing power
- High debt service costs (interest expense)

---

### **Why Southwest Declined Less Than Singapore:**

**Southwest: -15.3% → -43.2%**
**Singapore: 61.7% → -57.5%**

**Southwest started negative:**
- 2007: -15.3% (fuel hedging costs hit early)
- Already adapted to cost pressures
- 2008: -43.2% (further decline but from low base)

**Singapore started high:**
- 2007: 61.7% (strong premium demand)
- Cliff dive when premium collapsed
- 2008: -57.5% (119pt swing from 2007)

**Lesson:**
- Starting strong makes you vulnerable to falls
- Southwest's 2007 weakness = 2008 resilience
- Singapore's 2007 strength = 2008 collapse

## **Operating Income vs Sales Growth: The Critical Disconnect**

### **Chart Comparison:**

| Airline | Sales Growth 2008 | Op Income Growth 2008 | Spread | Quality |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|---------|
| **WestJet** | **+18.5%** | **-2.3%** | **20.8pts** | ✅ **Best** |
| Southwest | +11.8% | -43.2% | 55.0pts | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Lufthansa | +11.1% | 2753.3% | N/A | Outlier |
| **Continental** | **+7.1%** | **-145.7%** | **152.8pts** | ❌ **Worst** |
| Singapore | +0.1% | -57.5% | 57.6pts | ⚠️ Moderate |
| **Air Canada** | **+3.5%** | **-133.1%** | **136.6pts** | ❌ **Disaster** |

**The insight:**
- **Narrow spread = good** (revenue converts to profit)
- **Wide spread = bad** (revenue comes with losses)

**WestJet: 20.8pt spread**
- Growing revenue profitably
- Every revenue dollar adds to profit
- **Sustainable growth**

**Continental: 152.8pt spread**
- Growing revenue while losing money
- Every revenue dollar costs $2 to generate
- **Unsustainable death spiral**

## **Famous Quote:**

### **Warren Buffett:**
> **"Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked."**

**Application:**
- 2007: Tide in, everyone profitable (except Southwest)
- 2008: Tide out, exposed cost structures
- Continental/Air Canada: Swimming naked (fixed costs killed them)
- WestJet: Wearing swimsuit (flexible costs protected them)

## **Q&A:**

### **Q: Why is WestJet's -2.3% so much better than everyone else?**

**A:** Three factors:

**1. Low Fixed Costs:**
- Can adjust capacity fast (no hub constraints)
- Minimal legacy costs (pensions, old IT)
- Union flexibility (or non-union)

**2. Operating Margin Buffer:**
- Started with 13.9% margin (high)
- Dropped to 11.5% (still profitable)
- Competitors had 4-8% margins → went negative

**3. Cost Discipline:**
- Operating expenses rose only 3.1pts
- Competitors saw 5-10pt increases
- Every dollar of revenue still profitable

### **Q: How did Continental grow revenue (+7.1%) but collapse profit (-145.7%)?**

**A:** The death spiral:

**Revenue:**
- $14.2B → $15.2B (+$1.0B, +7.1%)
- Had to keep flying to cover fixed costs
- Slashed prices to fill planes

**Costs:**
- Operating expenses: $13.1B → $15.1B (+$2.0B, +15.7%)
- Fuel spiked (no hedging)
- Fixed costs couldn't be cut
- **Costs rose 2x faster than revenue**

**Result:**
- Operating income: $687M → -$314M
- Lost $1.0B in profit while gaining $1.0B in revenue
- **Every new revenue dollar cost $2 to generate**

### **Q: Why did Singapore go from best (61.7%) to negative (-57.5%)?**

**A:** Premium vulnerability:

**2007 (61.7%):**
- Strong business class demand
- Asian expansion
- Premium pricing power

**2008 (-57.5%):**
- Business travel froze (corporate cost cuts)
- Premium cabins empty (70% of revenue, 30% of seats)
- Long-haul routes unprofitable
- **Premium positioning = fragile in recession**

**Contrast with WestJet:**
- No business class to lose
- Economy demand more stable (people still fly, just cheaper)
- **Downside protection from low-price positioning**

### **Q: Should I ignore Lufthansa's 2753.3%?**

**A:** Yes, for competitive analysis:

**Why it's meaningless:**
- 2007: €15M operating income (near-zero)
- 2008: €428M operating income
- **Low base creates huge percentage**

**The math:**
```
(€428M - €15M) / €15M = 2753%
```

**What actually happened:**
- 2006: Restructuring year, operating income near-zero
- 2007: Still recovering (€15M)
- 2008: Normalized (€428M)
- **NOT crisis excellence, just base effects**

**Better metric:**
- Lufthansa 2008 operating margin: 1.7%
- WestJet 2008 operating margin: 11.5%
- **WestJet 6.8x more profitable**

### **Q: What's more important—sales growth or operating income growth?**

**A:** Depends on context:

**Sales Growth:**
- Shows market share gains
- Indicates demand strength
- Important for long-term

**Operating Income Growth:**
- Shows profitability
- Indicates business model health
- Critical for survival

**In 2008 Crisis:**
- **Operating income growth MORE important**
- Survival requires profits, not just revenue
- Continental's 7.1% sales couldn't save -145.7% profit collapse

**For WestJet:**
- Best of both: #1 sales growth (18.5%), #1 profit protection (-2.3%)
- **Quality AND quantity**

## **Technical Notes:**

### **Why Exclude Lufthansa from Chart:**

**Problem:**
- Scale: 2753.3% vs range of -145.7% to -2.3%
- Makes all other airlines invisible
- Bar chart unusable

**Solution:**
- Create two charts:
  1. With Lufthansa (shows outlier problem)
  2. Without Lufthansa (clean view)
- Explain outlier in notes

**Presentation:**
- Use "without Lufthansa" chart in slides
- Mention outlier verbally if asked
- Don't let it distract from WestJet story

### **Negative Growth Interpretation:**

**WestJet: -2.3%**
- Operating income: C$300M → C$293M
- Lost C$7M (2.3% decline)
- Still profitable, just slightly less

**Continental: -145.7%**
- Operating income: $687M → -$314M
- Lost $1,001M
- Went from profit to loss (below zero = >100% decline)
- **-145.7% means lost all profit + 45.7% more in losses**

### **Calculation Quirks:**

When going from positive to negative:
```
Continental:
2007: $687M
2008: -$314M
Change: -$1,001M
Growth % = -$1,001M / $687M = -145.7%
```

This creates percentages >100% (can lose more than you had).
