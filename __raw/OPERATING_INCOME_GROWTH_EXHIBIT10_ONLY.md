## **🎯 KEY FINDINGS FROM EXHIBIT 10:**

### **Finding 1: All Airlines Had Negative Operating Income Growth in 2008 (Except Lufthansa Outlier)**

**What Exhibit 10 shows:**
- WestJet 2008: -2.3%
- Southwest 2008: -43.2%
- Singapore 2008: -57.5%
- Air Canada 2008: -133.1%
- Continental 2008: -145.7%
- Lufthansa 2008: 2753.3% (outlier)

**What this means:**
- Universal profit decline in 2008
- WestJet had smallest decline
- Continental and Air Canada had largest declines

**Cannot say:** Anything about 2006 or why certain 2007 rates look the way they do.

---

### **Finding 2: WestJet Had Best Profit Protection in 2008**

**What Exhibit 10 shows:**
- WestJet: -2.3% (best)
- Gap to #2: 40.9 percentage points (Southwest -43.2%)
- Gap to worst: 143.4 percentage points (Continental -145.7%)

**Cross-reference other Exhibit 10 metrics (2008):**
- ROE: 16.4% (Row 18) - Highest
- ROA: 5.4% (Row 19) - Highest
- Sales Growth: 18.5% (Row 21) - Highest
- Return on Sales: 7.0% (Row 26) - Highest

**What this means:**
- WestJet led in ALL profitability and growth metrics in 2008
- Operating income decline minimal despite highest sales growth
- Quality of growth superior

---

### **Finding 3: Continental and Air Canada Had Negative ROE and ROA in 2008**

**What Exhibit 10 shows (2008):**

**Continental:**
- Operating Income Growth: -145.7% (Row 22)
- ROE: -557.1% (Row 18)
- ROA: -4.6% (Row 19)
- Sales Growth: 7.1% (Row 21)

**Air Canada:**
- Operating Income Growth: -133.1% (Row 22)
- ROE: -134.5% (Row 18)
- ROA: -9.0% (Row 19)
- Sales Growth: 3.5% (Row 21)

**What this means:**
- Both turned unprofitable (negative ROE/ROA = losses)
- Both still grew revenue (positive sales growth)
- Revenue growth + operating income collapse = losing money on operations

**Cannot say:** Why this happened beyond what metrics show. Can observe the pattern.

---

### **Finding 4: Leverage Exploded for Continental and Air Canada**

**What Exhibit 10 shows (Row 13: Debt-to-Equity):**

| Airline | 2007 | 2008 | Change |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| WestJet | 150.6% | 124.6% | **-26.0pts (improved)** |
| Southwest | 30.1% | 73.9% | +43.8pts |
| **Continental** | 323.7% | **5609.5%** | **+5285.8pts** |
| **Air Canada** | 180.9% | **702.6%** | **+521.7pts** |
| Singapore | 10.6% | 12.6% | +2.0pts |
| Lufthansa | 48.5% | 51.8% | +3.3pts |

**What this means:**
- Continental's debt-to-equity exploded (equity base nearly wiped out)
- Air Canada's nearly quadrupled
- WestJet's improved (equity preserved)

**Connection visible in Exhibit 10:**
- Continental: Operating income -145.7%, equity collapsed → leverage exploded
- WestJet: Operating income -2.3%, equity preserved → leverage improved

---

### **Finding 5: WestJet Maintained Profitability Metrics Both Years**

**What Exhibit 10 shows:**

| Metric | WestJet 2007 | WestJet 2008 | Change | 2008 Ranking |

## **🔍 OBSERVATIONS FROM EXHIBIT 10 (No Speculation):**

### **Observation 1: Operating Income Decline Correlated with Leverage**

**Pattern visible in Exhibit 10:**
- Smallest op income decline (WestJet -2.3%) → Leverage improved (-26pts)
- Largest op income declines (Continental -145.7%, Air Canada -133.1%) → Leverage exploded (+5286pts, +522pts)

**Cannot say:** Why this correlation exists. Can only observe the pattern.

- WestJet: 2.4 days (fastest cash collection)
- Southwest: 6.9 days
- Continental: 10.8 days (slowest among majors)

**Pattern:** Best operating income protection (WestJet) had fastest cash collection.

**Cannot say:** Causation. Can observe: Correlation between operational efficiency and profit protection.

## **❌ WHAT WE CANNOT SAY (No Data):**

1. **Cannot explain 2007 growth rates** - They reference 2006 data we don't have
2. **Cannot say why Air Canada's 2007 net income growth was -679.7%** - Would need 2006 data
3. **Cannot say "Air Canada recovered from bankruptcy"** - No 2006 context
4. **Cannot say "Southwest's fuel hedges"** - Not in Exhibit 10
5. **Cannot say "Lufthansa restructuring"** - Not in Exhibit 10
6. **Cannot attribute causes** - Can only observe patterns in metrics

## **✅ WHAT WE CAN SAY (Have Data):**

1. **WestJet had best operating income protection in 2008** (-2.3%, Exhibit 10 Row 22)
2. **WestJet led all profitability metrics in 2008** (ROE, ROA, Sales Growth, Return on Sales)
3. **Continental and Air Canada turned unprofitable** (negative ROE/ROA in 2008)
4. **Revenue growth did not prevent operating income collapse** (Continental, Air Canada patterns)

## **📊 PRESENTATION TALKING POINTS (Exhibit 10 Only):**

### **Opening:**
"Let's look at Exhibit 10, Row 22: Operating Income Growth. In 2008, every airline's operating income declined. But the range is striking: -2.3% to -145.7%."

### **The Winner:**
"WestJet had the smallest decline at -2.3%. And if we look across Row 18, they had the highest ROE at 16.4%. Row 19, highest ROA at 5.4%. Row 21, highest sales growth at 18.5%. They led across every metric."

### **The Losers:**
"Continental and Air Canada collapsed: -145.7% and -133.1%. Look at Row 18—their ROE went negative. Row 19—ROA negative. They were losing money. But Row 21 shows sales still growing. Revenue growth with losses."

### **The Leverage Story:**
"Why did Continental and Air Canada collapse so badly? Row 13 shows debt-to-equity. Continental: 5609.5%. Air Canada: 702.6%. Their equity bases nearly disappeared. Meanwhile, WestJet's improved from 150.6% to 124.6%."

### **The Punchline:**
"Exhibit 10 tells a clear story: WestJet protected profits, maintained profitability leadership, and strengthened their balance sheet. Continental and Air Canada grew revenue but lost money and saw their equity collapse. The data speaks for itself."

**This version sticks STRICTLY to what Exhibit 10 shows. No speculation. No 2006 references. Just the data.**
