# Operating Income Growth: The Story from Exhibit 10

## **What Exhibit 10 Shows (Row 22: Operating Income Growth)**

### **The Data:**

| Airline | 2008 | 2007 |
|---------|------|------|
| Southwest | -43.2% | -15.3% |
| Continental | -145.7% | 46.8% |
| Lufthansa | 2753.3% | -80.3% |
| Singapore | -57.5% | 61.7% |

| **WestJet** | **-2.3%** | **50.8%** |

---

## **🎯 THE STORY IN THREE ACTS:**

### **ACT 1: Pre-Crisis (2007) - "The Good Times"**

**What Exhibit 10 tells us:**

**Winners in 2007:**
1. **Air Canada: 91.1%** - Highest operating income growth
2. **Singapore: 61.7%** - Strong second place
3. **WestJet: 50.8%** - Solid third
4. **Continental: 46.8%** - Respectable fourth

**Losers in 2007:**
5. Southwest: -15.3% - Negative growth
6. Lufthansa: -80.3% - Deep negative

**The 2007 narrative:**
- Air Canada leading the pack
- Most airlines growing operating income strongly
- WestJet in the middle of the pack (3rd of 6)
- Southwest and Lufthansa struggling

---

### **ACT 2: Crisis Hit (2008) - "The Reversal"**

**What Exhibit 10 tells us:**

**2008 Rankings (Excluding Lufthansa outlier):**
1. **WestJet: -2.3%** - Best profit protection
2. Southwest: -43.2% - Distant second
3. Singapore: -57.5% - Moderate decline
4. Air Canada: -133.1% - Collapsed
5. Continental: -145.7% - Total collapse

**The 2008 narrative:**
- **ALL airlines went negative** (except Lufthansa outlier)
- Rankings completely reversed
- 2007 leaders became 2008 losers
- 2007 middle-of-pack became 2008 winner

---

### **ACT 3: The Transformation - "Rankings Reversed"**

**2007 → 2008 Movement:**

| Airline | 2007 Rank | 2008 Rank | Movement |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **WestJet** | **3rd** | **1st** | **↑↑ Rose 2 spots** |
| Southwest | 5th | 2nd | ↑↑↑ Rose 3 spots |
| Singapore | 2nd | 3rd | ↓ Fell 1 spot |
| Air Canada | 1st | 4th | ↓↓↓ Fell 3 spots |
| Continental | 4th | 5th | ↓ Fell 1 spot |

**The transformation:**
- WestJet: From middle-of-pack to champion
- Air Canada: From leader to disaster
- Crisis completely reordered competitive dynamics

---

## **📊 WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN:**

### **2007: Air Canada Led at 91.1%**

**What we see:**
- Highest operating income growth rate
- Far ahead of #2 Singapore (61.7%)

**What it means:**
- Strong performance in 2007
- But as we'll see, this didn't translate to crisis resilience

**Cross-reference to other Exhibit 10 data:**
- 2007 ROE: 17.6% (healthy)
- 2007 ROA: 3.6%
- 2007 Debt-to-equity: 180.9%

---

### **2007: WestJet at 50.8% (Middle of Pack)**

**What we see:**
- Third-best growth rate
- Behind Air Canada (91.1%) and Singapore (61.7%)
- Ahead of Continental (46.8%)

**What it means:**
- Solid but not spectacular
- Consistent with their sales growth (21.3% in 2007)

**Cross-reference to other Exhibit 10 data:**
- 2007 ROE: 20.3% (highest in group)
- 2007 ROA: 6.5%
- 2007 Sales growth: 21.3% (also highest)

**The pattern emerging:**
- WestJet had highest sales growth (21.3%)
- But only 3rd in operating income growth (50.8%)
- This suggests higher cost growth absorbed some revenue gains

---

### **2007: Southwest Negative at -15.3%**

**What we see:**
- Only airline with negative operating income growth in 2007
- Along with Lufthansa (-80.3%)

**What it means:**
- Operating income declined in 2007
- Pre-crisis struggles

**But note:**
- 2007 ROE: 9.3% (still profitable)
- 2007 ROA: 3.8%
- This negative growth didn't mean unprofitable, just declining profit

---

### **2008: WestJet Best at -2.3%**

**What we see:**
- Least negative growth rate
- 40.9 percentage points better than #2 Southwest (-43.2%)

**What it means:**
- Operating income barely declined
- Best profit protection in crisis

**Cross-reference to other Exhibit 10 data:**
- 2008 ROE: 16.4% (still highest)
- 2008 ROA: 5.4% (highest)
- 2008 Sales growth: 18.5% (highest)

**The pattern:**
- Maintained #1 position in ROE, ROA, and Sales
- Added #1 position in profit protection
- **Only airline leading across all growth and profitability metrics**

---

### **2008: Continental Collapsed at -145.7%**

**What we see:**
- Worst operating income growth
- 142.5 percentage point swing from 2007 (+46.8% to -145.7%)

**What it means:**
- Operating income went from profit to major loss
- Total collapse in profitability

**Cross-reference to other Exhibit 10 data:**
- 2008 ROE: -557.1% (negative)
- 2008 ROA: -4.6% (negative)
- 2008 Sales growth: 7.1% (still positive!)

**The disconnect:**
- Revenue grew 7.1%
- Operating income collapsed -145.7%
- **Growing revenue while losing money = death spiral**

---

### **2008: Air Canada at -133.1%**

**What we see:**
- Second-worst operating income growth
- 224.2 percentage point swing from 2007 (+91.1% to -133.1%)

**What it means:**
- Went from best performer to near-worst
- Biggest fall from grace

**Cross-reference to other Exhibit 10 data:**
- 2008 ROE: -134.5% (negative)
- 2008 ROA: -9.0% (worst in group)
- 2008 Sales growth: 3.5% (still positive)

**The pattern:**
- Similar to Continental: positive sales, negative profits
- But Air Canada's ROA (-9.0%) even worse than Continental's (-4.6%)

---

### **The Lufthansa Outlier: 2753.3%**

**What we see:**
- 2007: -80.3%
- 2008: 2753.3%
- Massive swing

**What it means:**
- Low 2007 base creates distorted percentage
- From near-zero to normalized profit
- Statistical artifact, not operational excellence

**Why it's an outlier:**

**Cross-reference to Exhibit 6 (Common-Sized Income Statements):**
- 2007 operating margin: 0.1% (near-zero)
- 2008 operating margin: 1.7%
- WestJet 2008: 11.5% margin (6.8x higher)

**The insight:**
- Lufthansa's percentage looks impressive (2753%)
- But absolute performance weak (1.7% margin)
- WestJet's -2.3% decline came from 11.5% margin = far superior

---

## **🔍 THE DEEPER STORY: CONNECTING THE DOTS**

### **Insight 1: Profitability Consistency Matters**

**WestJet's pattern across Exhibit 10:**

| Metric | 2007 | 2008 | Change | Status |
|--------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Sales Growth | 21.3% | 18.5% | -2.8pts | #1 both years |
| Op Income Growth | 50.8% | -2.3% | -53.1pts | 3rd → 1st |
| ROE | 20.3% | 16.4% | -3.9pts | #1 both years |
| ROA | 6.5% | 5.4% | -1.1pts | #1 both years |

**What this tells us:**
- Consistent leadership across all profitability metrics
- Moderate declines in crisis, but maintained #1 positions
- **Quality sustained through crisis**

---

### **Insight 2: Growth Without Profitability = Disaster**

**Continental's pattern across Exhibit 10:**

| Metric | 2007 | 2008 | Change | Status |
|--------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Sales Growth | 8.4% | 7.1% | -1.3pts | Stable |
| Op Income Growth | 46.8% | -145.7% | -192.5pts | COLLAPSED |
| ROE | 29.6% | -557.1% | -586.7pts | NEGATIVE |
| ROA | 3.8% | -4.6% | -8.4pts | NEGATIVE |

**What this tells us:**
- Sales growth barely declined (8.4% → 7.1%)
- But all profitability metrics collapsed
- **Revenue growth masked underlying disaster**

---

### **Insight 3: High Leverage Amplified Crisis**

**Debt-to-Equity Changes (Exhibit 10, Row 13):**

| Airline | 2007 | 2008 | Change | Op Inc Growth 2008 |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **WestJet** | 150.6% | 124.6% | **-26.0pts** | **-2.3%** |
| Southwest | 30.1% | 73.9% | +43.8pts | -43.2% |
| **Continental** | 323.7% | **5609.5%** | **+5285.8pts** | **-145.7%** |
| **Air Canada** | 180.9% | **702.6%** | **+521.7pts** | **-133.1%** |

**What this tells us:**
- WestJet: Debt-to-equity improved (down 26pts)
- Continental: Exploded to 5609.5% (equity base nearly wiped out)
- Air Canada: Quadrupled to 702.6%

**The connection:**
- High leverage = amplified crisis impact
- Continental/Air Canada's operating income collapse → equity collapse → leverage explosion
- WestJet's profit protection → equity preservation → leverage improvement

---

### **Insight 4: Operating Efficiency Visible in Metrics**

**Days Receivables (Exhibit 10, Row 7) - Lower = Faster Cash Collection:**

| Airline | 2007 | 2008 | Op Income Growth 2008 |
|---------|------|------|----------------------|
| **WestJet** | **2.5** | **2.4** | **-2.3% (Best)** |
| Southwest | 10.3 | 6.9 | -43.2% |
| Continental | 15.5 | 10.8 | -145.7% (Worst) |

**What this tells us:**
- WestJet collects cash in 2.4 days (fastest)
- Continental takes 10.8 days
- **Efficient operations = profit protection**

**Singapore (-57.5%):**
*"Operating income declined significantly. ROE fell from 13.1% to 7.9% (Exhibit 10 Row 18). ROA fell from 7.7% to 4.6% (Row 19). Remained profitable but severely impacted."*

**Air Canada (-133.1%):**
*"Second-worst collapse. ROE turned negative to -134.5% (Exhibit 10 Row 18). ROA worst in group at -9.0% (Row 19). Debt-to-equity exploded to 702.6% (Row 13). Sales grew 3.5% (Row 21) while operating income collapsed."*

**Continental (-145.7%):**
*"Worst operating income performance. ROE turned deeply negative to -557.1% (Exhibit 10 Row 18). ROA negative at -4.6% (Row 19). Debt-to-equity exploded to 5609.5% (Row 13), indicating near-equity wipeout. Sales grew 7.1% (Row 21) while losing money on operations—classic death spiral."*

## **🎯 THE ONE-SENTENCE STORY:**

**Based purely on Exhibit 10:**

*"WestJet rose from 3rd place in 2007 (50.8% operating income growth) to 1st in 2008 (-2.3%, best profit protection) while maintaining industry-leading ROE (16.4%) and ROA (5.4%), as competitors with higher 2007 growth rates—Air Canada (91.1%) and Continental (46.8%)—collapsed to deep negative territory (-133.1%, -145.7%) with revenue growth but operating losses."*

## **📊 PRESENTATION FLOW USING EXHIBIT 10:**

### **Slide 1: "The 2007 Rankings" (Chart 1)**
**Show:** Operating income growth 2007
**Highlight:** Air Canada #1 (91.1%), WestJet #3 (50.8%)
**Say:** "In 2007, Air Canada led operating income growth at 91.1%. WestJet was a solid third at 50.8%. But notice WestJet had the highest ROE at 20.3% [show Exhibit 10 Row 18], suggesting their quality was better than ranking."

### **Slide 2: "The Crisis Hit" (Chart 2)**
**Show:** Operating income growth 2008
**Highlight:** All negative except Lufthansa outlier
**Say:** "2008 changed everything. Every airline's operating income declined. But look at the range: -2.3% to -145.7%. That's a 143-percentage-point spread."

### **Slide 3: "WestJet Rose, Air Canada Fell"**
**Show:** Both charts side-by-side or ranking movement table
**Highlight:** WestJet 3rd → 1st, Air Canada 1st → 4th
**Say:** "WestJet went from 3rd to 1st. Air Canada fell from 1st to 4th, collapsing -133.1%. The crisis reversed the rankings."

### **Slide 4: "The Profitability Story" (Exhibit 10 Table)**
**Show:** ROE and ROA comparison 2007 vs 2008
**Highlight:** WestJet #1 in both years, Continental/Air Canada turned negative
**Say:** "Exhibit 10 shows WestJet maintained the highest ROE (16.4%) and ROA (5.4%) in 2008. Continental and Air Canada turned negative. Operating income growth alone doesn't tell the story—sustained profitability does."

### **Slide 5: "The Leverage Effect" (Exhibit 10 Row 13)**
**Show:** Debt-to-equity changes
**Highlight:** Continental 5609.5%, Air Canada 702.6%, WestJet 124.6%
**Say:** "Why did Continental and Air Canada collapse so badly? Look at debt-to-equity. Continental's exploded to 5609%—their equity base was nearly wiped out. WestJet's actually improved to 124.6%. Financial discipline protected them."

### **Slide 6: "Revenue Growth ≠ Profit" (Exhibit 10 Rows 21-22)**
**Show:** Sales growth vs operating income growth comparison
**Highlight:** Continental +7.1% sales, -145.7% op income
**Say:** "Continental grew revenue 7.1% in 2008 [Exhibit 10 Row 21] but operating income collapsed -145.7% [Row 22]. WestJet grew revenue 18.5% with only -2.3% operating income decline. That's the difference between growing profitably and growing into bankruptcy."
