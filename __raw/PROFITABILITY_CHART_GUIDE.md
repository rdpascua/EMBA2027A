# Profitability vs Peers - ONE POWERFUL CHART Guide

## **RECOMMENDED: Combination Chart with Dual Axis**

This is the most powerful way to show WestJet's profitability dominance across all metrics in ONE chart.

---

## **Chart Type: Clustered Column + Line Chart (Combo)**

### **Why This Works:**
✓ Shows 4 profitability metrics simultaneously
✓ Visual hierarchy (bars for emphasis, lines for trends)
✓ Dual Y-axis handles different scale ranges
✓ Immediate competitive positioning visible
✓ Professional, executive-ready format

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **File to Use:**
`profitability_multiaxis_filtered.csv` (WestJet, Southwest, Lufthansa, Singapore only)

### **Excel Setup:**

#### **Step 1: Insert Chart**
- Select data range A1:E5
- Insert → Combo Chart → Clustered Column + Line on Secondary Axis

#### **Step 2: Configure Series**

**PRIMARY AXIS (Left) - COLUMNS:**
- Return on Equity % → Clustered Column (Blue)
- Return on Assets % → Clustered Column (Light Blue)

**SECONDARY AXIS (Right) - LINES:**
- Operating Margin % → Line with Markers (Orange)
- Net Profit Margin % → Line with Markers (Green)

#### **Step 3: Format**

**Primary Y-Axis (Left):**
- Title: "Return Metrics (%)"
- Range: 0% to 20%
- Shows ROE and ROA

**Secondary Y-Axis (Right):**
- Title: "Margin Metrics (%)"
- Range: 0% to 12%
- Shows Operating and Net Profit Margins

**Chart Title:**
"WestJet Profitability Leadership - Multi-Metric Comparison 2008"

**Legend:**
- Position: Bottom
- Order: ROE, ROA, Operating Margin, Net Profit Margin

---

## **Alternative: 100% Stacked Column (Normalized View)**

If you want to show **relative performance** instead of absolute:

### **Create Indexed Version:**

Each airline's metrics shown as percentage of the highest performer in that category.

**Formula:** (Airline Value / Max Value) × 100

### **Example:**
- WestJet ROE: 16.4 / 16.4 = 100%
- Southwest ROE: 3.6 / 16.4 = 22%
- Lufthansa ROE: 8.7 / 16.4 = 53%

This creates a "performance score" chart showing WestJet at 100% across most metrics.

---

## **Alternative 3: Radar/Spider Chart**

For a more visual "at-a-glance" comparison:

### **Setup:**
- Insert → Other Charts → Radar
- Use `profitability_multiaxis_filtered.csv`
- Each airline becomes a colored shape
- Larger shape = better profitability

### **Advantage:**
- Very visual
- Easy to see WestJet "dominates" the space
- Great for presentations

### **Disadvantage:**
- Less precise for exact values
- Can look too "informal" for some audiences

## **Advanced: Add Benchmark Lines**

Add horizontal reference lines:

1. **Industry Average Line** (calculated from your data)
   - ROE Average: 9.2%
   - ROA Average: 3.5%
   - Shows WestJet is 78% above industry average ROE

2. **Target/Threshold Line**
   - E.g., "15% ROE = Excellent" line
   - WestJet exceeds, others fall short

---

## **For PowerPoint Presentation:**

If exporting to slides:

1. **Slide 1: The Chart** (full slide)
   - Title: "WestJet: Profitability Leader Across All Metrics"

2. **Slide 2: So What?**
   - Bullet points of competitive advantages
   - Investment implications

3. **Animation Suggestion:**
   - Bars appear first (show returns)
   - Then lines animate in (show margins)
   - Creates storytelling flow

---

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

❌ Don't include Continental/Air Canada without filtering - breaks scale
❌ Don't use 3D charts - looks unprofessional
❌ Don't use too many colors - creates visual chaos
❌ Don't forget axis labels - confuses audience
❌ Don't make chart too small - hard to read

✓ DO use dual axis for different scale ranges
✓ DO highlight WestJet prominently
✓ DO add data labels to WestJet bars
✓ DO include source note
✓ DO keep it clean and simple
