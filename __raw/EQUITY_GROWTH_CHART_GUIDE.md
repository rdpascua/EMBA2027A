# Equity Growth Analysis - WestJet vs Competitors (2008 Crisis)

## **The Story:**

"During the 2008 financial crisis, all airlines saw equity decline. WestJet preserved capital better than most giants."

---

## **Key Findings:**

### **Equity Growth Rankings (2007 to 2008):**

| Rank | Airline | Equity Growth % | 2008 Book Equity | 2007 Book Equity | Context |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| **1** | **Lufthansa** | **-4.4%** | €9.63B | €10.08B | Best preservation (large) |
| **2** | **WestJet** | **-7.7%** | **C$887M** | **C$961M** | **2nd best (smallest)** |
| 3 | Singapore | -15.9% | SGD$9.53B | SGD$11.34B | Moderate decline |
| 4 | Southwest | -28.6% | $4.95B | $6.94B | Significant decline |
| 5 | Air Canada | -74.8% | C$623M | C$2.47B | Severe erosion |
| 6 | Continental | -93.2% | $105M | $1.55B | Near wipeout |

## **What This Means:**

### **Equity Growth = Capital Preservation Ability**

During crisis:
- **Positive equity growth** = Adding capital (rare in 2008)
- **Small negative growth** = Good capital preservation
- **Large negative growth** = Burning through shareholder value

### **WestJet's Position:**

**-7.7% equity decline** means:
- Lost C$74M in book equity (C$961M → C$887M)
- But **2nd best preservation** among all airlines
- Better than airlines 4-10x its size
- Only Lufthansa did better (-4.4%)

**Why This Matters:**
- Small loss shows resilient business model
- Maintained financial flexibility for recovery
- Avoided dilutive capital raises
- Protected shareholder value

## **Alternative Chart: Size vs Equity Growth Scatter**

### **Chart Type: Scatter Plot**

**Purpose:** Show relationship between size and capital preservation

**Axes:**
- X-axis: 2007 Book Equity (Size)
- Y-axis: Equity Growth %
- Bubble Size: Optional (could use revenue)

**What It Shows:**
- **No correlation between size and equity preservation**
- Largest (Lufthansa €10B) did best
- Smallest (WestJet C$961M) did 2nd best
- Mid-sized airlines (Continental, Air Canada) worst

**Key Insight:**
"Size doesn't predict resilience. Business model quality does."

## **Equity Growth vs Other Metrics:**

### **Correlation Analysis:**

| Metric | Correlation with Equity Growth | Insight |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| ROE 2008 | Strong positive | Profitable airlines preserved equity better |
| Sales Growth | Moderate positive | Growth helped but not decisive |
| Debt-to-Equity | Strong negative | High leverage = worse equity erosion |
| Operating Margin | Strong positive | Profitability = capital preservation |

**WestJet's Formula:**
- High ROE (16.4%) → Generated retained earnings
- Low debt-to-equity (124.6%) → Avoided dilution/capital calls
- Positive operating margin (11.5%) → Cash generation offset equity decline
- Result: -7.7% equity decline (2nd best)

## **Comparison Chart: Equity Growth vs Net Income Growth**

### **Chart Setup: Dual-Axis Column Chart**

**Purpose:** Show how profit drives equity changes

**Primary Axis (Left):** Equity Growth %
**Secondary Axis (Right):** Net Income Growth %

**Data:**
| Airline | Equity Growth % | Net Income Growth % |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| WestJet | -7.7% | -7.8% |
| Southwest | -28.6% | -72.4% |
| Continental | -93.2% | -227.5% |
| Lufthansa | -4.4% | -63.8% |
| Singapore | -15.9% | -44.0% |
| Air Canada | -74.8% | -338.9% |

**Pattern:**
- Airlines with smaller profit declines preserved equity better
- WestJet: -7.8% profit decline → -7.7% equity decline (nearly 1:1)
- Continental: -227.5% profit decline → -93.2% equity decline (massive erosion)

**Annotation:**
"WestJet's equity decline matched profit decline - no financial engineering, just operational performance"

## **Key Insight Box:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
EQUITY GROWTH FINDING:

WestJet preserved shareholder capital better than
airlines 4-10x its size during worst crisis in history:

• -7.7% equity decline (2nd best of 6 airlines)
• Lost only C$74M in book value
• 5x better than industry average (-37.4%)
• Only Lufthansa (10x larger) did better

HOW?
• Net income declined only 7.8% (best in group)
• Low leverage (124.6% debt-to-equity) avoided dilution
• No distressed capital raises needed
• Operating profitability = equity preservation

IMPLICATION:
In crisis, profitability trumps size for capital
preservation. WestJet's lean model protected equity
while legacy carriers burned through shareholder value.

## **Q&A Preparation:**

### **Q: "Why did WestJet's equity decline at all if they were profitable?"**

**A:** Even profitable companies can see equity decline if:
1. Net income drops year-over-year (-7.8%)
2. Dividends paid out (WestJet maintained dividends)
3. Share buybacks reduce equity base
4. Currency translation effects (CAD weakened)

WestJet's -7.7% equity decline closely matched their -7.8% net income decline, showing pure operational impact without financial engineering.

### **Q: "How did Lufthansa do better with worse net income performance?"**

**A:** Lufthansa had:
- Larger starting equity base (€10.08B vs C$961M)
- Lower debt-to-equity ratio (51.8% vs 124.6%)
- One-time operating income recovery (2753% growth from near-zero)
- More diversified revenue (cargo, catering, MRO)

But relative to size, WestJet's performance is more impressive.

### **Q: "What happened to Continental and Air Canada?"**

**A:** Both faced severe capital erosion:

**Continental:**
- Lost 93% of equity ($1.55B → $105M)
- Debt-to-equity exploded to 5609.5%
- Near-insolvency territory
- **Outcome:** Merged with United (2010) - distressed combination

**Air Canada:**
- Lost 75% of equity (C$2.47B → C$623M)
- Net income: -338.9% (massive losses)
- High leverage amplified crisis
- **Outcome:** Continued restructuring, multiple near-bankruptcies

### **Q: "Is negative equity growth always bad?"**

**A:** Context matters:

**In Growth Phase:** Negative equity growth can signal:
- Share buybacks (returning cash to shareholders)
- High dividend payout (distributing profits)
- Investment in growth (spending exceeds income)

**In Crisis (2008):** Negative equity growth signals:
- Losses eating into capital base
- Inability to generate retained earnings
- Financial distress if severe (-50%+)

WestJet's -7.7% was **controlled decline** (matched earnings), not financial distress.

### **Q: "Why does this matter for valuation?"**

**A:** Equity growth affects:

1. **Book Value:** Lower equity = lower book value per share
   - WestJet market-to-book: 1.9x (premium valuation)
   - Market values growth potential, not just book equity

2. **Return on Equity:** Lower equity base can inflate ROE
   - Continental: -557% ROE (meaningless with $105M equity)
   - WestJet: 16.4% ROE on stable equity base (credible)

3. **Financial Flexibility:** Companies with strong equity can:
   - Invest in growth without dilution
   - Weather future crises
   - Avoid distressed capital raises

WestJet preserved equity → positioned for growth recovery

### **Q: "Should I invest based on equity growth alone?"**

**A:** No. Equity growth is **one signal** among many:

**Positive Signals:**
- WestJet: 2nd best equity preservation
- WestJet: Highest ROE (16.4%)
- WestJet: Best sales growth (18.5%)

**Negative Signals:**
- Stock down 50% despite strong fundamentals
- Market pricing in sustainability concerns
- Forward P/E lower than historical average

**Use equity growth to:**
- Assess capital preservation ability
- Identify resilient business models
- Screen for financial distress
- But combine with profitability, growth, and valuation metrics

## **Technical Notes:**

### **Data Source:**
- Exhibit 9: Book value of equity (2007, 2008)
- All values in millions of original currency
- No currency normalization needed (growth % unaffected)

### **Calculation:**
```
Equity Growth % = (2008 Book Equity - 2007 Book Equity) / 2007 Book Equity

WestJet Example:
(C$887M - C$961M) / C$961M = -C$74M / C$961M = -7.7%
```

### **Why Book Equity vs Market Equity:**
- **Book Equity:** Actual shareholder capital on balance sheet
- **Market Equity:** Stock price × shares outstanding (market perception)

For **capital preservation analysis**, book equity is correct metric because:
- Shows actual financial position
- Not affected by market sentiment
- Reflects cumulative retained earnings
- Determines financial flexibility

Market equity would tell different story (stock price changes), but less relevant for operational resilience assessment.
