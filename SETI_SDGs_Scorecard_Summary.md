# SETI for SDGs Scorecard - Executive Summary

## What is SETI?
**Science, Engineering, Technology and Innovation (SETI)** - A framework developed to assess how science and technology projects contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Philippine Leadership 🇵🇭
The **Philippines spearheaded this global initiative** through:
- **Department of Science and Technology Region XI (DOST XI)**
- **HELP Davao Network**
- Initial pilot in Davao Region (2016-2018)
- Expanded from 7 SDGs to all 17 SDGs after UNESCO Jakarta adoption (December 2018)

## Why DOST XI Developed This Tool

### Key Drivers:
1. **AP-FAST Project Opportunity** - Malaysian-funded UNESCO project in Davao Region
2. **Measurement Gap** - No existing tool to assess SETI contributions to SDGs
3. **Resource Optimization** - Need to prioritize limited funding for maximum impact
4. **Evidence-Based Planning** - Justify SETI investments with concrete results
5. **Regional Leadership** - Position Philippines as SDG implementation innovator

## Core Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Assessment Tool** | Systematically evaluate SETI projects' SDG contributions |
| **Gap Identification** | Identify where more SETI investment is needed |
| **Evidence-Based Decisions** | Quantify direct/indirect impacts on SDG achievement |
| **Cross-Sectoral Integration** | Address interconnected development challenges |
| **Accountability Framework** | Track progress transparently |

## ASEAN Country Involvement

### Confirmed Participants:
- **🇵🇭 Philippines** - Lead developer and implementer
- **🇲🇾 Malaysia** - Primary funder through MFIT, multiple institutions involved
- **🇮🇩 Indonesia** - UNESCO Jakarta adopted for Asia-Pacific region
- **🇰🇭 Cambodia** - Ministry of Environment participation
- **🇹🇱 Timor-Leste** - University representation

### Regional Adoption:
- Adopted by UNESCO for **all Asia-Pacific projects**
- Potential use by all ASEAN countries under UNESCO programs

## Key Features

### Scoring System:
- **1-9 Responsiveness Scale**
  - 7-9: Highly responsive to SDGs
  - 4-6.99: Moderately responsive
  - 1-3.99: Slightly responsive

### Impact Classification:
- **Direct Impact** - Output directly contributes to SDG indicators
- **Indirect Impact** - Output indirectly supports SDG achievement

### Coverage:
- ✅ All 17 SDGs
- ✅ 152 SETI-related targets (out of 169)
- ✅ 215 SETI-related indicators (out of 244)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Local to Global Success** - Philippine local initiative became international standard
2. **SETI is Essential** - Technology is crucial for achieving every SDG
3. **Practical Measurement** - Moves from theory to quantifiable impacts
4. **Resource Allocation Tool** - Helps prioritize investments
5. **Multi-SDG Impact** - Projects typically affect multiple goals
6. **Bottom-Up Development** - Stakeholder-driven, not imposed

## Applications

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Pre-Project** | Evaluate proposals before funding |
| **During Implementation** | Monitor ongoing project impacts |
| **Post-Project** | Assess completed project outcomes |
| **Strategic Planning** | Identify SDG gaps needing SETI investment |

## Implementation Formula

The SETI Scorecard uses a specific formula to calculate project responsiveness:

```
RESPONSIVENESS SCORE = [(Likelihood × Relevance) × (1 if Direct Impact; 0.5 if Indirect Impact)]
```

Where:
- **Likelihood** = Progress towards completion (1-3 scale)
- **Relevance** = Contribution to SDG attainment (1-3 scale)
- **Impact Factor** = 1.0 for direct, 0.5 for indirect contribution

## Sample Projects Evaluated

The scorecard has been tested on various projects including:
1. Community-based Learning Center Rehabilitation (Davao)
2. Water Resilience and Disaster Management Platform
3. Hyperthermophilic Composting Solutions for Food Production

## Impact
This tool transforms abstract SDG commitments into **measurable, actionable project assessments**, essentially answering: *"How do we know if our science and technology investments are actually achieving sustainable development?"*

## Future Directions

- Expansion beyond Asia-Pacific region
- Integration with national development planning systems
- Digital platform development for automated scoring
- Capacity building for SETI scorecard implementation
