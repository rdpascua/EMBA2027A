| Quarter | Period | Growth vs Previous Quarter |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| Baseline | Jan-Mar 2014 | INR 141,350 (soft launch) |

**Phase 2: Steady State Growth (2015-2017)**

  - E-commerce industry: 35%
- (Note: Case doesn't specify which rate or blended approach)

---

### **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS**

#### **Strengths of Strategy:**

1. **Market Timing**: Positioned at intersection of two high-growth industries
2. **Founder Fit**: Engineering + IT experience + passion for crafts
3. **Asset-Light Model**: Low inventory (15-20%), no receivables
4. **Direct Relationships**: Personal network built through India tour
5. **Contemporary Positioning**: Differentiates from traditional handicraft sellers
6. **Technology Platform**: Can scale without proportional cost increases
7. **First-Mover Potential**: Niche positioning in growing market

#### **Weaknesses/Risks of Strategy:**

1. **Cost Structure Misalignment**:
   - SG&A fixed component (INR 279,554) is 197.8% of Q1 sales
   - Variable component (20% of sales) adds more burden
   - Total SG&A will be INR 279,554 + 20% of sales
   - At current scale, unsustainable

2. **Funding Assumption Disconnect**:
   - Burning INR 224,660 per quarter
   - Only INR 628,195 cash remaining
   - Runway: 2.8 quarters (~8 months)
   - Yet "hoping" to self-finance
   - "Hesitant" to raise more capital

3. **Aggressive Growth Required**:
   - Need 5.1x sales to breakeven (if margins hold)
   - Dependent on 300%, 100%, 100%, 30% quarterly growth
   - Based on "research" of other startups
   - High execution risk

4. **No Prior Experience**:
   - First entrepreneurial venture
   - No background in handicrafts
   - No e-commerce experience
   - Learning while burning cash

5. **Limited Competitive Moat**:
   - Large players (Flipkart, Amazon) could enter category
   - Product curation replicable
   - Artisan relationships not exclusive
   - Technology platform not proprietary

6. **Family Funding Pressure**:
   - INR 1 million from family/friends
   - Already lost 22.5% in 3 months
   - "Hesitant" to go back for more
   - Emotional/relationship pressure

---

### **STRATEGIC COHERENCE ASSESSMENT**

**What Makes Sense:**
- Market selection (two growth industries converging)
- Contemporary positioning (differentiated)
- Asset-light model (appropriate for startup)
- Technology platform (scalable)
- E-commerce delivery (broad reach)

**What Doesn't Make Sense:**
- Cost structure (SG&A far too high for revenue base)
- Self-financing goal (mathematically impossible at current burn)
- No contingency planning evident (hoping it works out)
- Reluctance to raise capital (when clearly needed)

**Critical Strategic Gap:**

The strategy assumes **operating leverage will materialize** (SG&A as % of sales will decline), but:
- Fixed SG&A of INR 279,554 is too high
- Variable SG&A of 20% prevents margin expansion
- Even with 300% growth, Q2 would be:
  - Sales: INR 565,400
  - SG&A: INR 279,554 + 20%(565,400) = INR 392,634
  - Still 69.4% of sales (vs industry norm of 20-40%)

**Bottom Line**:
The strategy is conceptually sound but **operationally unsustainable** without either:
1. Dramatic SG&A reduction (40-50%), OR
2. Even more aggressive sales growth, OR
3. External funding to bridge to scale, OR
4. All of the above

Adarsh's hope to "self-finance" is **inconsistent** with the financial reality of:
- 2.8 quarter runway
- 197.8% SG&A ratio
- 5.1x sales growth needed for breakeven

## 3. SALES ASSUMPTIONS & FORECAST DRIVERS

### **Given Sales Assumptions (from case):**

**Year 1: April 2014 - March 2015**

Starting from Q1 2014 (Jan-Mar) baseline: INR 141,350

| Quarter | Period | Growth Rate | Calculation | Projected Sales |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | Apr-Jun 2014 | 300% | 141,350 × 4.0 | INR 565,400 |
| Q2 | Jul-Sep 2014 | 100% | 565,400 × 2.0 | INR 1,130,800 |
| Q3 | Oct-Dec 2014 | 100% | 1,130,800 × 2.0 | INR 2,261,600 |
| Q4 | Jan-Mar 2015 | 30% | 2,261,600 × 1.3 | INR 2,940,080 |
| **Total FY 2014-15** | | | | **INR 6,897,880** |

**Year 2: 2015-2016**
- Grow at "industry standard growth rate"
- Options: 18% (handicrafts) or 35% (e-commerce) or blended
- Case doesn't specify which

**Year 3: 2016-2017**
- Same as Year 2 approach

### **Cost Assumptions (from case):**

**COGS:**
- Q1 2014: INR 40,623 on sales of INR 141,350 = 28.7%
- Assumption: Likely to continue at ~28.7%

**Other Direct Expenses:**
- **Given**: 6-8% of Sales (shipping/freight)
- Q1 2014: INR 45,833 on sales of INR 141,350 = 32.4%
- Note: 32.4% is higher than stated 6-8% range
- Possible explanations:
  - Q1 inefficiencies
  - Setup costs included
  - Will normalize to 6-8% going forward

**SG&A:**
- **Formula given**: INR 279,554 (fixed) + 20% of sales
- Q1 2014 check: INR 279,554 + 20%(141,350) = INR 307,824
- But Q1 actual was INR 279,554
- Implies: Either formula applies to projections only, OR no variable component in Q1

**Inventory:**
- **Given**: 15-20% of sales
- Q1 2014: INR 21,203 / INR 141,350 = 15%
- Assumption: Maintain at 15% (conservative end of range)

**Receivables:**
- Base case: 0 days (all cash)
- Sensitivity: 70 days starting FY 2014-15
