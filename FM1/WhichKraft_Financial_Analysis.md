## DATA FROM CASE FILES

### **Actual Results: Jan 2014 - March 2014 (3 months)**

**Income Statement:**
- Net Sales: ₹141,350
- Less: COGS: ₹40,623
- Less: Other Direct Expenses: ₹45,833
- **Gross Profit: ₹54,894**
- SG&A Expenses: ₹279,554
- **EBIT: -₹224,660**
- Income Taxes: ₹0
- **Profit/Loss After Tax: -₹224,660**

**Balance Sheet:**
- Website, IP rights: ₹125,943
- Inventory: ₹21,202.50
- Cash: ₹628,194.50
- **Total Assets: ₹775,340**
- Paid up capital: ₹1,000,000
- Profit/Loss: -₹224,660
- **Total Shareholder's Equity: ₹775,340**

### **Key Metrics from Actual Period:**

| Metric | Value | % of Sales |
|--------|-------|------------|
| COGS | ₹40,623 | 28.7% |
| Other Direct Expenses | ₹45,833 | 32.4% |
| Gross Profit | ₹54,894 | 38.8% |
| SG&A | ₹279,554 | 197.8% |
| Net Loss | ₹224,660 | -158.9% |

**Inventory:** ₹21,202.50 = 15% of Net Sales

### **Case Assumptions for Forecasting:**

From Excel template:
1. Inventory = 15% of Sales for the next 3 years
2. All operations are in Cash
3. Cash formula: Beginning cash + Net income - Change in Inventory = Ending cash
4. Paid up capital remains: ₹1,000,000
5. Website/IP rights: ₹125,943 (no depreciation mentioned)

**Forecast periods:**
- 2014-2015 (full year)
- 2015-2016
- 2016-2017

### **Sensitivity Analysis Assumptions (from questions):**

Starting in year ended March 2015 and onward:
1. Receivables: 70 days
2. COGS: increases to 35% of sales

## CALCULATIONS BASED ON CASE DATA

### **Cost Structure Analysis:**

```
For every ₹100 of Sales in Q1 2014:
- COGS:                  ₹28.70
- Other Direct:          ₹32.40
- Contribution:          ₹38.90
- SG&A:                  ₹197.80
- Net Loss:              ₹158.90
```

**Key Issue:** SG&A is nearly 2x sales revenue

### **Base Case Margins:**

- Gross Margin: 38.8% (after COGS + Other Direct)
- Net margin contribution before SG&A: 38.8%
- Effective net margin: -158.9%

### **Sensitivity Case Margins:**

If COGS increases to 35%:
- COGS: 35.0%
- Other Direct: 32.4%
- Gross Margin: 32.6% (vs 38.8% base)
- **Margin compression: 6.2 percentage points**

## FINANCIAL FORECAST TEMPLATE

### **Required to Complete:**

1. **Sales Assumptions** (to be filled based on case - appears quarterly sales needed for Q2-Q4 2014 and Q1 2015)
2. **Annual sales** for 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017
3. **Calculate:** COGS, Other Direct, Gross Profit, EBIT, Net Income
4. **Calculate:** Inventory changes, Cash position
5. **For sensitivity:** Add receivables calculation (70 days of sales)

### **Cash Flow Formula (from case):**

```
Beginning Cash + Net Income - Change in Inventory = Ending Cash
```

**For sensitivity case with receivables:**
```
Beginning Cash + Net Income - Change in Inventory - Change in Receivables = Ending Cash
```

Where: Receivables = (Annual Sales / 365) × 70 days

## KEY QUESTIONS FROM ASSIGNMENT GUIDE

### **Question 3: Forecast & Assumptions**

**Need to determine from case:**
- Sales growth assumptions for each period
- How SG&A will scale (fixed? grow with sales?)
- Any other cost changes

**Key drivers identified:**
1. Sales growth rate (PRIMARY DRIVER)
2. Gross margin stability (COGS + Other Direct % holding)
3. SG&A leverage (must grow slower than sales to reach profitability)
4. Working capital (inventory at 15%, receivables in sensitivity)

**Breakeven calculation:**
```
If SG&A remains at ₹279,554 per quarter:
Gross Profit needed = ₹279,554
At 38.8% gross margin: Sales needed = ₹279,554 / 0.388 = ₹720,500/quarter
Current sales: ₹141,350
Required growth: 5.1x current level
```

### **Question 4: Financial Health Assessment**

**Profitability:**
- Current: Highly unprofitable (-158.9% net margin)
- Issue: SG&A at 197.8% of sales
- Path to profit: Need massive revenue growth OR significant SG&A cuts

**Liquidity:**
- Cash: ₹628,195 (81% of assets)
- Current burn rate: ₹224,660 per quarter
- Runway: 2.8 quarters (~8-9 months) at current rate
- Strong liquidity BUT burning through quickly

**Capital Position:**
- Total equity: ₹775,340
- No debt mentioned
- Already lost 22.5% of paid-up capital in 3 months
- Clean capital structure but eroding

**Risks:**
- Unsustainable burn rate
- SG&A must achieve leverage
- Limited runway without revenue growth or funding

### **Question 5: Sensitivity Analysis Impact**

**Changes:**
- COGS: 28.7% → 35% (+6.3pp)
- Receivables: 0 days → 70 days

**Impact on profitability:**
```
On ₹141,350 sales (Q1 equivalent):

Base Case Gross Profit:
₹141,350 × 38.8% = ₹54,844

Sensitivity Gross Profit:
₹141,350 × 32.6% = ₹46,080

Difference: -₹8,764 per quarter on same sales
```

**Impact on cash:**
```
Receivables tied up = (Sales / 365) × 70

On annualized Q1 sales (₹565,400):
Receivables = ₹108,491

This cash is locked up and unavailable
```

**Combined impact:**
- Lower profitability by ₹8,764/quarter
- Cash tied up in receivables: ₹108,491+
- Working capital needs increase significantly
- Cash runway shortens materially

### **Question 6: External Funding Need**

**Base Case:**

Current cash: ₹628,195
Current burn: ₹224,660/quarter

Even WITH revenue growth, need funding because:
1. Growth requires working capital (inventory builds)
2. SG&A will likely grow (even if sub-linearly)
3. Need buffer for operations

**Trigger: Within 6-12 months** if revenue doesn't scale dramatically

**Sensitivity Case:**

Worse position:
- Higher burn (lower gross margin)
- More working capital needed (receivables)
- Cash crunch accelerates

**Trigger: Within 3-6 months** - more urgent funding need

**Internal cash generation:**
Currently NEGATIVE - not generating, consuming cash
Cannot sustain without external funding OR:
- Dramatic revenue growth (5-10x)
- Significant cost reductions
- Both simultaneously

## ANSWER TO QUESTION 7: STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### **Current Situation (Facts from case):**

**Assets:**
- ₹628K cash (good)
- ₹126K website/IP
- ₹21K inventory

**Liabilities:**
- None (clean)

**Performance:**
- Burning ₹225K per quarter
- Gross margin 38.8% (decent)
- SG&A eating 197.8% of sales (critical problem)

### **The Core Issue:**

SG&A at ₹279,554 per quarter vs Sales at ₹141,350
- Every ₹1 of sales creates ₹1.59 of loss
- Not sustainable beyond 2-3 quarters

### **Recommendation: MODIFY STRATEGY**

**Should NOT:**
- Continue unchanged (will run out of cash in 8-9 months)
- Pursue sensitivity scenario (35% COGS + 70-day AR) without securing funding first

**Should DO:**

**Immediate (Month 1-3):**
1. **Cut SG&A aggressively** - target 40-50% reduction
   - Current: ₹279,554/quarter
   - Target: ₹150,000-180,000/quarter
   - Extends runway to 15+ months

2. **Focus on revenue acceleration**
   - Need 5-10x growth to reach viability
   - Test most efficient customer acquisition channels
   - Prioritize repeat customers

**Near-term (Month 3-6):**
3. **Prove unit economics**
   - Show customer acquisition cost declining
   - Demonstrate gross margin holding at 38.8%
   - Evidence of SG&A leverage

4. **Secure seed funding**
   - Target: ₹500,000-750,000
   - Use extended runway to negotiate from strength
   - Need capital for growth after proving concept

**Conditions to continue business:**
- ✓ Can reduce SG&A burn by 40%+ immediately
- ✓ Can demonstrate 3-5x revenue growth potential
- ✓ Can secure funding within 6 months
- ✓ Gross margin holds or improves

**Conditions to reconsider:**
- ✗ Cannot cut costs meaningfully
- ✗ Revenue growth not materializing
- ✗ No funding available
- ✗ Competitive pressure destroys margins

### **On Sensitivity Scenario:**

**Only pursue (35% COGS + 70-day receivables) IF:**
1. Funding secured FIRST (minimum ₹1.5M)
2. "Better product line" justifies premium pricing (+15-20%)
3. Receivables only for creditworthy B2B customers
4. Can still maintain 40%+ gross margin after adjustments

**Otherwise:** 32.6% gross margin insufficient given cost structure

---

## SUMMARY

**Facts from case:**
- 3-month operations: ₹141K sales, ₹225K loss
- Gross margin: 38.8%
- SG&A: 197.8% of sales (THE problem)
- Cash: ₹628K (8-9 month runway)
- No debt, clean cap structure

**Critical issues:**
1. Unsustainable cost structure
2. Need 5x+ revenue growth to breakeven
3. Limited time to prove viability
4. Must show operating leverage

**Path forward:**
1. Cut costs immediately (40% SG&A reduction)
2. Prove revenue traction (3-5x growth)
3. Secure funding (₹500-750K within 6 months)
4. Scale with discipline
5. Avoid sensitivity scenario unless funded

**Bottom line:** Business has potential (decent gross margin, asset-light model, clean balance sheet) BUT current execution unsustainable. Needs immediate strategic modification to survive.
