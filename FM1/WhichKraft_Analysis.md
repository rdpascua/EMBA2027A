## 2. ADARSH SHETTY'S STRATEGY

Based on the financial data and case context, Adarsh Shetty's strategy appears to be:

### **Core Strategy Elements:**

1. **Niche Market Focus**
   - Targeting handicrafts specifically (not broad e-commerce)
   - Differentiation through authentic, curated products
   - Serving customers seeking unique, artisanal products

2. **Asset-Light Model**
   - Inventory: Only 15% of sales (₹21,203 on ₹141,350 sales)
   - Suggests possible consignment or made-to-order approach
   - Low working capital requirements for inventory

3. **Digital-First Platform**
   - Investment in Website/IP rights: ₹125,943 (16% of total assets)
   - Focus on online channel exclusively
   - Technology as competitive advantage

4. **Initial Capital Deployment**
   - Paid-up capital: ₹1,000,000
   - Strong initial cash position: ₹628,195 (81% of assets)
   - Conservative financial positioning

### **Strategic Challenges Evident:**

1. **Cost Structure Issues**
   - COGS: 28.7% of sales (reasonable)
   - Other Direct Expenses: 32.4% (high - likely logistics/payment gateway)
   - **SG&A: 197.8% of sales** (unsustainable - major red flag)
   - Total costs: 258.9% of revenue

2. **Growth vs. Profitability Tension**
   - Burning ₹224,660 per quarter
   - Annual burn rate: ~₹900,000
   - Current runway: ~2.8 quarters without revenue growth

3. **Scale Imperative**
   - High fixed costs (SG&A) need revenue scale to absorb
   - Customer acquisition costs likely embedded in SG&A
   - Platform business requires critical mass

### **Implied Strategic Intent:**

**Phase 1 (Current):** Market entry, brand building, platform development
- Invest heavily in SG&A (marketing, technology, operations)
- Accept initial losses as investment
- Build supplier and customer base

**Phase 2 (Planned):** Scale and efficiency
- Revenue growth to absorb fixed costs
- Improve gross margins through better sourcing
- Reduce SG&A as % of sales through operating leverage

**Phase 3 (Target):** Profitability and sustainability
- Achieve positive unit economics
- Generate cash flow from operations
- Potential for market leadership in niche

---

## 3. FINANCIAL FORECASTING

### **Key Assumptions Needed (to be extracted from case):**

Based on the Excel template, the forecast requires:

1. **Revenue Assumptions:**
   - Sales growth rate (quarterly/annual)
   - Seasonality patterns
   - Market expansion plans

2. **Cost Assumptions:**
   - COGS: Expected at 28.7% (or changes planned?)
   - Other Direct: 32.4% stable or efficiency gains?
   - SG&A: Absolute amount or % scaling?

3. **Working Capital:**
   - Inventory: 15% of sales (case specifies this continues)
   - Receivables: Initially 0 (all cash), then 70 days in sensitivity
   - Payables: Not mentioned (assumed 0)

4. **Cash Flow Formula Given:**
   ```
   Beginning Cash + Net Income - Change in Inventory = Ending Cash
   ```

### **Critical Analysis of Sales Assumptions:**

**Without specific growth rates from the PDF, typical concerns would be:**

1. **Optimism Bias:**
   - E-commerce startups often project exponential growth
   - Market penetration assumptions may be aggressive
   - Competition impact often underestimated

2. **Seasonality:**
   - Handicrafts have strong seasonal patterns
   - Q1 (Jan-Mar) may not be representative
   - Festival seasons (Diwali, weddings) drive 40-50% of annual sales

3. **Customer Acquisition:**
   - CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) likely embedded in SG&A
   - Repeat purchase rates critical for unit economics
   - Viral/organic growth difficult to forecast

4. **Competitive Dynamics:**
   - Large players (Amazon, Flipkart) entering all categories
   - Price competition may compress margins
   - Marketing costs may increase, not decrease

**Reasonableness Checks:**

✓ **What seems reasonable:**
- Asset-light inventory model (15% of sales)
- COGS at 28.7% (typical for curated retail)
- Strong initial cash position

⚠️ **What seems concerning:**
- SG&A at 197.8% cannot persist
- Assumes SG&A leverage without proof
- No scenario planning for slower growth

### **Key Forecast Drivers:**

1. **Revenue Growth Rate** (most critical)
   - Drives all other line items
   - Determines path to profitability
   - Impacts cash runway

2. **SG&A Management**
   - Must decline as % of sales
   - Fixed vs. variable component split
   - Efficiency gains from scale

3. **Working Capital Changes**
   - Inventory build for growth
   - Receivables if payment terms change
   - Cash flow timing critical

4. **Gross Margin Stability**
   - Can it maintain 38.8%?
   - Pricing power vs. competition
   - Supplier relationship strength

## 4. FINANCIAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT

### **Current Financial Position (Q1 2014):**

#### **Profitability Analysis:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Gross Margin | 38.8% | ✓ Strong - indicates good product mix |
| Operating Margin (EBIT) | -158.9% | ⚠️ Highly negative - unsustainable |
| Net Margin | -158.9% | ⚠️ Burning cash rapidly |
| Return on Assets | -29.0% | ⚠️ Destroying value currently |

**Profitability Concerns:**
- Every ₹1 of sales generates ₹1.59 of loss
- Requires ~6.5x revenue increase just to break even
- Path to profitability depends entirely on revenue scale

**Positive Signs:**
- Gross margin of 38.8% provides cushion
- If SG&A can be controlled, underlying economics viable

#### **Liquidity Analysis:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Cash | ₹628,195 | ✓ Strong buffer |
| Cash / Total Assets | 81.0% | ✓ Very liquid |
| Quarterly Burn | ₹224,660 | ⚠️ High relative to cash |
| Runway | 2.8 quarters | ⚠️ Limited time horizon |

**Liquidity Concerns:**
- Current burn rate exhausts cash in 8-9 months
- Assumes no revenue growth (unrealistic)
- But also assumes no additional investment needs

**Strengths:**
- No debt - clean capital structure
- All operations in cash (no receivables risk)
- Flexibility for strategic pivots

#### **Capital Position:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Equity | ₹775,340 | ✓ Positive |
| Debt | ₹0 | ✓ No leverage risk |
| Paid-up Capital | ₹1,000,000 | ✓ Well-capitalized initially |
| Retained Earnings | -₹224,660 | ⚠️ Accumulating losses |

**Capital Structure:**
- 100% equity financed - low financial risk
- Capital consumption: 22.5% in first quarter alone
- Can sustain ~3-4 quarters at current burn
- Will need external funding for growth

#### **Asset Efficiency:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Asset Turnover | 0.18x (annualized: 0.73x) | ⚠️ Low utilization |
| Inventory Days | 54 days | ✓ Efficient |
| Cash Conversion Cycle | 54 days | ✓ Good |

**Efficiency Notes:**
- Low asset turnover reflects early stage
- Inventory management appears good
- Most assets are unproductive (cash, website)

### **Patterns & Risks Emerging:**

#### **Critical Risks:**

1. **Burn Rate Risk** (HIGH)
   - Current trajectory: insolvent in 8-9 months
   - Requires immediate revenue traction
   - Limited room for execution delays

2. **Operating Leverage Risk** (HIGH)
   - SG&A is 197.8% of sales - assumes massive growth
   - If growth disappoints, losses accelerate
   - Fixed cost structure very rigid

3. **Market Risk** (MEDIUM)
   - Unproven business model
   - Competition from larger players
   - Customer acquisition economics uncertain

4. **Working Capital Risk** (LOW currently, HIGH if scales)
   - Currently asset-light (positive)
   - But growth requires inventory build
   - Receivables expansion (sensitivity scenario) problematic

#### **Positive Patterns:**

1. **Product Economics**
   - Gross margin of 38.8% is healthy
   - Indicates product-market fit potential
   - Room for price optimization

2. **Capital Discipline**
   - Conservative inventory management
   - No premature debt accumulation
   - Focus on proving concept first

### **Growth Sustainability Assessment:**

**For business to be sustainable, needs:**

✓ **Revenue must grow 10x** to reach breakeven (~₹1.4M/quarter)
- Requires customer acquisition to accelerate
- Market receptivity to prove out
- Competitive position to defend

✓ **SG&A must scale sub-linearly**
- Cannot grow proportionally with revenue
- Fixed cost leverage must materialize
- Efficiency gains required

✓ **Gross margin must hold or expand**
- Supplier relationships must strengthen
- Pricing power must sustain
- Product mix must remain favorable

**Verdict:**
Current growth path is **not sustainable** without:
1. Significant revenue acceleration (5-10x)
2. SG&A leverage materializing
3. External funding within 2-3 quarters
4. Proof of unit economics improvement

## 5. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### **Scenario: 70-Day Receivables + 35% COGS**

**Changed Assumptions:**
1. **Receivables:** From 0 days → 70 days (starting FY 2014-15)
2. **COGS:** From 28.7% → 35% of sales

### **Impact Analysis:**

#### **Profitability Impact:**

| Item | Base Case | Sensitivity | Change |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| COGS % | 28.7% | 35.0% | +6.3 pp |
| Gross Margin % | 38.8% | 33.5% | -5.3 pp |
| Gross Profit (Q1 equiv) | ₹54,894 | ₹45,552 | -₹9,342 |

**Profitability Concerns:**
- Gross margin compression by 5.3 percentage points
- On ₹141,350 sales, loses ₹9,342 additional gross profit
- Breakeven revenue now requires even higher sales (7.5x vs 6.5x)
- Path to profitability becomes steeper

**Why COGS increases:**
- "Wider and better product line" suggests:
  - More premium/complex products (higher cost)
  - Potentially better artisan compensation
  - Higher quality standards
  - More diverse SKUs (less economies of scale)

#### **Cash Flow Impact:**

**Receivables Introduction (70 days):**

```
Receivables = (Sales / 365) × 70 days

For Q1 Sales of ₹141,350 (3 months):
Annual run-rate: ₹565,400
Receivables = (₹565,400 / 365) × 70 = ₹108,491
```

**Cash Flow Formula:**
```
Beginning Cash + Net Income - Δ Inventory - Δ Receivables = Ending Cash
```

**Impact on Q1 equivalent:**
- Base case ending cash: ₹628,195 + (-₹224,660) - Δ Inventory
- Sensitivity case: Additional ₹108,491 locked in receivables
- **Cash reduction: ₹117,833** (₹9,342 lower profit + ₹108,491 receivables)

**Quarterly impact on ₹141,350 sales:**
- Net income worse by ₹9,342
- Cash tied up in receivables: ₹108,491
- **Total cash drain: ₹117,833 worse than base case**

#### **Working Capital Pressure:**

| Component | Base Case | Sensitivity | Change |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Inventory | ₹21,203 | ₹21,203 | ₹0 |
| Receivables | ₹0 | ₹108,491 | +₹108,491 |
| Working Capital | ₹21,203 | ₹129,694 | +₹108,491 |

**Working Capital Analysis:**
- Working capital increases by 6.1x
- Cash conversion cycle extends from 54 days to 124 days
- Every rupee of growth requires much more funding

#### **Short-Term Viability:**

**Base Case Runway:**
- Cash: ₹628,195
- Quarterly burn: ₹224,660
- Runway: 2.8 quarters (8.4 months)

**Sensitivity Case Runway:**
- Cash: ₹628,195
- Worse net income by: ₹9,342/quarter
- Receivables build: ₹108,491 initially, then grows with sales
- **Runway: ~2.3 quarters (6.9 months)** - 18% shorter

**Critical Impacts:**
⚠️ Burns through cash 18% faster
⚠️ Requires external funding sooner
⚠️ Less room for experimentation/pivots
⚠️ Higher growth = faster cash drain (working capital trap)

#### **Long-Term Viability:**

**Positive Scenario (Revenue scales 10x):**
- Base case: Receivables still ₹0, manageable
- Sensitivity: Receivables balloon to ₹1M+, requires significant funding
- Growth becomes self-defeating without external capital

**Negative Scenario (Revenue disappoints):**
- Base case: Can pivot, has time
- Sensitivity: Forced to seek funding from weak position
- Valuation suffers, dilution increases

**Breakeven Analysis:**

Base case breakeven:
```
Gross Profit = SG&A + Other Direct
38.8% × Sales = 32.4% × Sales + ₹279,554
6.4% × Sales = ₹279,554
Sales = ₹4,368,031 per quarter
```

Sensitivity case breakeven:
```
33.5% × Sales = 32.4% × Sales + ₹279,554
1.1% × Sales = ₹279,554
Sales = ₹25,413,091 per quarter
```

**Breakeven requires 180x current revenue** (vs 31x in base case)
- Effectively impossible without SG&A leverage
- Business model becomes unviable at current cost structure

### **Key Financial Indicators:**

| Indicator | Base Case | Sensitivity | Assessment |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Gross Margin | 38.8% | 33.5% | ⚠️ Compressed |
| Cash Runway | 8.4 months | 6.9 months | ⚠️ Shorter |
| Working Cap/Sales | 15% | 92% | ⚠️ Capital intensive |
| Breakeven Sales | 31x current | 180x current | ⚠️ Unrealistic |
| Cash Conversion | 54 days | 124 days | ⚠️ Much slower |

### **Verdict on Sensitivity Scenario:**

**Short-term:** Business becomes significantly more fragile
- Faster cash burn
- Earlier funding need
- Less flexibility

**Long-term:** Business model viability questionable
- Gross margin too thin given cost structure
- Working capital trap: growth = cash drain
- Requires either: (a) massive SG&A cuts, or (b) much higher prices

**Recommendation:**
This scenario makes the business **materially less viable**. Should only pursue if:
1. Can secure funding commitment upfront
2. SG&A can be cut dramatically
3. Premium pricing justified by "better product line"
4. Receivables necessary for B2B/institutional sales that offset risk

---

## 6. EXTERNAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

### **Funding Triggers & Conditions:**

#### **Immediate Triggers (Within 6 months):**

1. **Revenue Growth Below Plan**
   - If quarterly sales < ₹300,000, funding needed by Q3
   - Break-even requires ₹1.4M/quarter (base case)
   - Any shortfall accelerates funding need

2. **Cost Overruns**
   - SG&A above ₹280K/quarter unsustainable
   - Marketing costs often exceed plans in customer acquisition
   - Technology/operational issues requiring investment

3. **Working Capital Expansion**
   - Implementing 70-day receivables requires immediate ₹100K+
   - Inventory build for wider product line
   - Seasonal inventory pre-positioning

4. **Competitive Response**
   - Price pressure requiring marketing spend
   - Customer acquisition costs increasing
   - Platform/feature development to match competitors

#### **Structural Triggers (Within 12 months):**

1. **Growth Investment**
   - Even if hitting plan, growth requires funding
   - Customer acquisition costs upfront
   - Geographic/product expansion
   - Team building and infrastructure

2. **Path to Profitability Extended**
   - If gross margin compresses (sensitivity scenario)
   - If SG&A leverage slower than expected
   - If customer retention lower than modeled

3. **Strategic Opportunities**
   - Artisan network expansion
   - Technology platform enhancement
   - Brand building investments
   - Partnership/M&A opportunities

### **Funding Need Analysis:**

#### **Base Case Scenario:**

**Assumptions:**
- Revenue grows 3x per year (conservative for startup)
- SG&A grows 50% per year (demonstrates leverage)
- Gross margin holds at 38.8%

**Year 1 (FY 2014-15):**
- Revenue: ₹565,400 (Q1) → ₹1,696,200 (annual)
- SG&A: ₹1,118,216 (4 × ₹279,554)
- Net Loss: ~₹850,000
- Beginning cash: ₹628,195
- **Funding gap: ₹221,805** (by end of year)

**Year 2 (FY 2015-16):**
- Revenue: ₹5,088,600 (3x growth)
- SG&A: ₹1,677,324 (50% growth)
- Net Loss: ~₹300,000
- **Cumulative funding need: ₹521,805**

**Year 3 (FY 2016-17):**
- Revenue: ₹15,265,800 (3x growth)
- SG&A: ₹2,515,986 (50% growth)
- Net Income: ~₹250,000 (turning profitable)
- But working capital needs for growth
- **Cumulative funding need: ₹700,000**

#### **Sensitivity Scenario (70-day receivables + 35% COGS):**

**Year 1:**
- Lower gross margin (33.5% vs 38.8%)
- Additional losses: ₹75,000+
- Receivables: ₹325,000 tied up
- **Funding gap: ₹621,805**

**Year 2:**
- Gross margin pressure continues
- Receivables grow to ₹975,000
- **Cumulative funding need: ₹1,600,000**

**Year 3:**
- Business may never reach profitability at 33.5% gross margin
- **Total funding need: ₹2,500,000+**

### **Internal Cash Generation Sufficiency:**

#### **Cash Sources:**

✓ **Initial Capital:** ₹1,000,000
✓ **Retained Cash:** ₹628,195 (after Q1 losses)
✗ **Operations:** Negative cash flow for 2-3 years

**Total Internal Resources:** ₹628,195 remaining

#### **Cash Uses:**

Required for base case growth: ₹700,000 (3-year horizon)
Required for sensitivity case: ₹2,500,000 (3-year horizon)

**Verdict:** Internal cash generation is **insufficient**

- Base case: Need ₹71,805 in Year 1, potentially more for growth
- Sensitivity case: Need ₹621,805 in Year 1
- Operating losses continue until scale achieved
- Working capital consumes cash as business grows

### **Funding Recommendation:**

#### **Timing:**

**Immediate (Month 6-9):**
- Seed/Angel round: ₹500,000 - ₹750,000
- Bridges to proof of concept
- Validates unit economics

**Medium-term (Month 18-24):**
- Series A: ₹2,000,000 - ₹3,000,000
- Funds scale-up if metrics proven
- Builds competitive moat

#### **Amount:**

**Base Case:**
- First round: ₹750,000
  - 12-month runway at current burn
  - Cushion for growth investments
  - Proof of concept completion

**Sensitivity Case:**
- First round: ₹1,500,000
  - 12-month runway with higher burn
  - Working capital requirements
  - Less margin for error

#### **Conditions for Successful Funding:**

Must demonstrate:
1. **Revenue traction:** 3x+ quarterly growth
2. **Unit economics improvement:** CAC/LTV ratio improving
3. **Gross margin stability:** Holding 38%+ (not 33.5%)
4. **SG&A leverage:** Declining as % of sales
5. **Market validation:** Repeat purchase rates, NPS scores

#### **Funding Alternatives:**

1. **Equity (Recommended):**
   - VC/Angel investors
   - Dilutive but patient capital
   - Brings expertise and network

2. **Debt (Not recommended at this stage):**
   - No cash flow to service
   - Collateral limited
   - Increases risk profile

3. **Revenue-based Financing:**
   - Possible if revenue accelerates
   - Less dilutive than equity
   - But requires revenue traction first

4. **Strategic Partner:**
   - Larger e-commerce player
   - Provides capital + distribution
   - Risk of losing independence

### **Financial Model Outputs Supporting Funding Need:**

*To maintain 6-month runway and fund growth
```

**Key Insight:** Even in optimistic base case, funding required by Year 2 to:
- Maintain prudent cash reserves
- Fund working capital growth
- Invest in customer acquisition
- Build competitive advantages

## 7. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### **Overall Assessment:**

WhichKraft faces a **high-risk, high-potential** situation. The business has:

✓ **Strengths:**
- Attractive niche market (handicrafts)
- Asset-light model (low inventory)
- Reasonable gross margins (38.8%)
- Clean capital structure (no debt)
- Early-mover advantage in niche

⚠️ **Critical Weaknesses:**
- Unsustainable cost structure (SG&A at 197.8% of sales)
- Unproven unit economics
- Limited cash runway (8-9 months)
- Path to profitability requires 30x+ revenue growth
- Vulnerable to competitive pressure

### **Recommendation: MODIFY STRATEGY**

Adarsh Shetty should **not continue with current strategy unchanged**, nor should he **abandon the business entirely**. Instead, a **strategic modification** is essential.

### **Recommended Action Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: IMMEDIATE (Months 1-6) - Survival & Proof of Concept**

**Priority 1: Slash SG&A Burn**

Current SG&A (₹279,554/quarter) is the existential threat.

Actions:
- **Audit all SG&A expenses:** Identify fixed vs. variable
- **Cut non-essential spending by 30-40%:** Target ₹180K/quarter
  - Reduce marketing to most efficient channels only
  - Defer non-critical technology investments
  - Minimize team size to core members
  - Eliminate office space (work remote)

Target: Extend runway from 8 months to 14 months

**Priority 2: Prove Unit Economics**

Focus on **quality over quantity** in customer acquisition:
- Track CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) by channel
- Measure LTV (Lifetime Value) through repeat purchases
- Identify most efficient acquisition channels
- Build organic/viral channels (content, social, referrals)

Target: CAC:LTV ratio of 1:3 or better

**Priority 3: Optimize Gross Margin**

Defend or expand the 38.8% gross margin:
- Negotiate better terms with high-volume artisans
- Optimize product mix toward higher-margin items
- Test price sensitivity (can likely increase 10-15%)
- Reduce "Other Direct Expenses" (₹45,833 = 32.4% of sales)
  - Optimize logistics
  - Negotiate payment gateway fees
  - Reduce packaging costs

Target: Gross margin to 42-45%

**Priority 4: Secure Seed Funding**

Do not wait until cash is exhausted:
- Raise ₹500K-750K in seed/angel funding
- Use runway extension (from SG&A cuts) to negotiate from strength
- Articulate clear path to profitability
- Show early traction metrics

Target: Funding closed by Month 6

#### **Phase 2: MEDIUM-TERM (Months 6-18) - Scale with Discipline**

**Priority 1: Revenue Acceleration**

With funding secured and burn controlled, focus on growth:
- Target 3-5x annual revenue growth
- Expand product categories methodically
- Build repeat customer base (80/20 rule)
- Develop B2B channel (corporate gifting, hotels, exporters)

Target: ₹5-7M annual revenue by end of 18 months

**Priority 2: Operational Leverage**

Demonstrate that SG&A grows sub-linearly:
- Automate customer service (chatbots, FAQs)
- Systematize artisan onboarding
- Optimize marketing spend (data-driven)
- Build brand (reduce CAC over time)

Target: SG&A at 50-60% of sales (vs 197.8% today)

**Priority 3: Strategic Differentiation**

Build defensible competitive advantages:
- **Artisan relationships:** Exclusive partnerships
- **Quality curation:** Become trusted brand
- **Custom products:** Made-to-order capabilities
- **Storytelling:** Connect customers to artisan stories
- **Technology:** Superior discovery/search

**Priority 4: Working Capital Management**

- Maintain 15% inventory-to-sales ratio (asset-light)
- **Avoid 70-day receivables** unless:
  - For B2B customers only (not B2C)
  - With credit insurance or guarantees
  - At premium pricing to compensate
- Negotiate payment terms with artisans (30-45 days payable)

#### **Phase 3: LONG-TERM (Months 18-36) - Path to Profitability**

**Priority 1: Achieve Operating Profitability**

- Target gross margin: 45%+
- Target SG&A as % of sales: <40%
- Target net margin: 5-10%
- Target annual revenue: ₹15-20M

**Priority 2: Build Scale & Moat**

- Become #1 platform for authentic Indian handicrafts
- Develop technology platform for artisan onboarding
- Create brand that commands premium pricing
- Build community (customers + artisans)

**Priority 3: Strategic Options**

With proof of concept and path to profitability:
- Series A funding (₹2-3M) for rapid expansion
- Strategic partnership with larger e-commerce player
- Geographic expansion (international markets)
- Adjacent categories (home decor, fashion accessories)

### **Alternative Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario A: If Funding Not Available**

If unable to raise seed funding by Month 6:

**Option 1 - Pivot to B2B:**
- Focus on corporate gifting, exports, bulk orders
- Reduces customer acquisition costs
- Accept 70-day receivables if necessary (larger orders justify)
- Potentially higher margins on custom orders

**Option 2 - Lifestyle Business:**
- Reduce SG&A to ₹50K/quarter
- Target ₹200K quarterly revenue (achievable)
- Profitable at small scale
- Slower growth but sustainable

**Option 3 - Shut Down:**
- If no path to funding and no profitability at small scale
- Preserve remaining ₹400K capital
- Learn from experience, try again

#### **Scenario B: Sensitivity Case (70d receivables + 35% COGS)**

If this is the only path forward (wider product line required):

**Do NOT proceed unless:**
1. Can raise ₹1.5M minimum in seed funding
2. Can demonstrate premium pricing (10-15% higher) justifies higher COGS
3. Can cut SG&A to ₹150K/quarter or less
4. Have creditworthy B2B customers justifying receivables

Otherwise: Gross margin of 33.5% is insufficient given cost structure.

### **Key Decision Criteria:**

Adarsh should continue with **modified strategy** IF:
1. ✓ Can reduce SG&A burn by 30%+ immediately
2. ✓ Can prove unit economics (CAC:LTV) within 6 months
3. ✓ Can secure seed funding (₹500-750K) by Month 6
4. ✓ Can achieve 3x revenue growth in first year

Adarsh should **reconsider entirely** IF:
1. ✗ Unable to cut costs (SG&A remains >₹250K/quarter)
2. ✗ No funding available and no path to profitability at small scale
3. ✗ Unit economics don't improve (high CAC, low LTV)
4. ✗ Competitive pressure makes market untenable

### **Final Recommendation:**

**MODIFY STRATEGY with URGENCY:**

1. **Immediate cost cuts** (next 30 days)
   - Reduce SG&A to ₹180K/quarter
   - Extend runway to 12-14 months

2. **Focus on proof of concept** (Months 1-6)
   - Prove unit economics work
   - Show revenue traction (3x growth)
   - Demonstrate gross margin can hold or expand

3. **Secure seed funding** (Month 6)
   - Raise ₹500-750K
   - From position of strength (metrics improving)

4. **Scale with discipline** (Months 6-18)
   - Revenue growth with SG&A leverage
   - Build defensible competitive advantages

5. **Path to profitability** (Months 18-36)
   - Operating profitability achieved
   - Series A for acceleration

**The current strategy's fatal flaw is the cost structure.** Fix that first, then prove the model works at small scale, then scale with external funding.

**The business opportunity is real** - Indian handicrafts + e-commerce is a genuine market need. But execution must be much more capital-efficient to survive and thrive.

## APPENDIX: KEY ASSUMPTIONS & FORMULAS

### **Financial Formulas Used:**

**Income Statement:**
```
Net Sales
- COGS (% of sales)
- Other Direct Expenses (% of sales)
= Gross Profit

- SG&A Expenses
= EBIT

- Income Taxes
= Net Income
```

**Balance Sheet:**
```
Assets:
  Website/IP Rights (fixed)
  Inventory (15% of next period sales)
  Cash (calculated from cash flow)

Liabilities & Equity:
  Paid-up Capital (fixed)
  Retained Earnings (cumulative net income)
```

**Cash Flow:**
```
Beginning Cash
+ Net Income
- Change in Inventory
- Change in Receivables (if applicable)
= Ending Cash
```

**Key Ratios:**
```
Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Net Sales
Operating Margin = EBIT / Net Sales
Net Margin = Net Income / Net Sales
Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets
Asset Turnover = Net Sales / Total Assets
Days Inventory = (Inventory / COGS) × 365
Days Receivables = (Receivables / Net Sales) × 365
Cash Conversion Cycle = Days Inventory + Days Receivables - Days Payables
```

### **Base Case Assumptions:**

- COGS: 28.7% of sales
- Other Direct Expenses: 32.4% of sales
- Inventory: 15% of sales
- Receivables: 0 days (all cash)
- SG&A: Absolute amount with assumed leverage over time
- Website/IP: ₹125,943 (no depreciation mentioned)
- Paid-up Capital: ₹1,000,000

### **Sensitivity Case Assumptions:**

- COGS: 35% of sales (increased from 28.7%)
- Receivables: 70 days (from FY 2014-15 onward)
- All other assumptions same as base case
