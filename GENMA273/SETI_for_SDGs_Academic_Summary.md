## 📚 What You Need to Know About SETI

Think of **SETI** as a toolbox containing four essential tools:
- **Science** - Understanding how things work
- **Engineering** - Building solutions
- **Technology** - Tools and systems we create
- **Innovation** - New ways of solving problems

According to the UNESCO document (page 5), SETI "contributes essentially to every Sustainable Development Goal." This means that scientific and technological advancements are not just helpful but **necessary** for achieving global sustainability goals.

## 🇵🇭 Why This Matters: The Philippine Story

### The Beginning (2016-2017)
The story starts in **Davao City, Philippines**, where local scientists and development workers faced a common problem: *How do we know if our technology projects are actually helping achieve sustainable development?*

As stated in the document (page 3):
> "The Davao Region AP-FAST Project was funded by the Malayan Funds in Trust (MFIT) through the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Office Jakarta"

### The Innovation
The **Department of Science and Technology Region XI (DOST XI)** partnered with **HELP Davao Network** to create something new: a scoring system that could measure how technology projects contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

Key innovators cited (pages 36-37):
- Dr. Anthony C. Sales (DOST XI Regional Director)
- Dr. Ruth U. Gamboa (UP Mindanao)
- Engr. Cristeta G. Gallano (Davao River Initiatives)
- And 16 other local experts

### From Local to Global (December 2018)
What started as a local tool became an international standard. The document notes (page 5):
> "During the APFAST Final Meeting on December 2018 in Davao City, Philippines, the SETI Scorecard was adopted by UNESCO Office Jakarta for the evaluation and monitoring of all the UNESCO-supported projects in Asia and the Pacific region."

## 🎯 How the Scorecard Works (In Simple Terms)

### The Basic Question
*"Will this technology project help achieve sustainable development?"*

### The Scoring System
Think of it like grading a project on two main factors:

1. **Likelihood** (Will it actually happen?)
   - Score of 3: 80-100% likely to succeed
   - Score of 2: 51-79% likely to succeed
   - Score of 1: 50% or less likely to succeed

2. **Relevance** (How much will it help?)
   - Score of 3: Huge contribution to SDGs
   - Score of 2: Moderate contribution
   - Score of 1: Small contribution

### The Math (Simplified)
As shown on page 11, the formula is:
```
Final Score = Likelihood × Relevance × Impact Type
```
Where Impact Type is:
- 1.0 for direct impact (directly solves the problem)
- 0.5 for indirect impact (helps in a roundabout way)

### Real Example from the Document (Page 13)
**Project:** Community Learning Center in Davao
**Technology Component:** Urban Container Gardening facility
**SDG Target:** Sustainable cities (SDG 11)
**Scoring:**
- Likelihood: 2 (facility partially ready)
- Relevance: 2 (food production helps cities)
- Impact: Indirect (0.5)
- **Final Score: 2 × 2 × 0.5 = 2**

## 💡 Key Lessons for Business and Sustainability

### 1. Measurement Matters
You can't manage what you don't measure. The scorecard provides concrete numbers to abstract concepts like "sustainable development."

### 2. Local Solutions Can Scale Globally
A solution developed in Davao City is now used across Asia-Pacific. This shows that developing countries can lead in creating global standards.

### 3. Technology Is Essential for Sustainability
The document identifies that 152 out of 169 SDG targets (90%) require SETI involvement (page 17).

### 4. Collaboration Is Key
The project involved:
- Government agencies
- Universities
- NGOs
- International organizations
- Private sector
