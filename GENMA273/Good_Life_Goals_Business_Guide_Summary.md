## 🎯 Executive Overview: What Are Good Life Goals?

The **Good Life Goals** transform the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals into **85 personal actions** that anyone can take. Think of it as translating global policy language into everyday human language.

According to page 3:
> "The Good Life Goals are personal actions that everyone around the world can take to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

### The Innovation
Instead of technical SDG numbers like "SDG 14.1", people see:
- 🐟 **"Love Your Ocean"** with actions like "Eat less fish"
- 🌱 **"Eat Better"** with "Buy local food"
- 💪 **"Stay Well"** with "Get vaccinated"

## 📊 The Business Challenge (Why This Matters)

### The Awareness Gap
The document reveals a critical disconnect (page 4):
- **Only 9%** of people in developed countries have heard of the SDGs
- Yet **74%** say they want to learn more about living sustainably

### The Business Opportunity
From page 5:
> "Engaging in Good Life Goals initiatives demonstrates leadership in sustainability, increases brand loyalty and provides new business opportunities"

Three key benefits for businesses:
1. **Build brand trust** through authentic sustainability action
2. **Engage employees** with meaningful purpose
3. **Tap into $12 trillion** in SDG-related business opportunities by 2030
